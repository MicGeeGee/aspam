Squid plate was absolutely amazing ..The fried chicken plate could feed an army ..Great price great food Its Five Star Fri again!!!....I finally returned to Loreto's after trying to hit this place around the holidays.  During the holidays they only do catering... Ok so I heard about this place a while back when it was featured on Bizarre Foods. I'm a burger gal and always had this place mentally marked although I... I believe a BBQ place should have 2 main things in their restaurant. A smoker and greens. ....We ordered 2 pulled pork sandwiches and a small side of greens.... The perfect pizza in the most ghetto neighborhood.. And that's not bad! Get cultivated! ..Awesome taste. Thin crust pizza that tastes: Bomb! Bomb! Bomb!..As... Pretty decent crawfish joint. Came here late  Night. Looks like we missed the rush but then they were not caught up yet.
