Hello Dear,

I'm Miss.Mariame=C2=A0 24yrs old female, from Benghazi =E2=80=93 Libya seek=
ing for
your assistance regards to my situation since the death of my
parents.My father of blessed memory by name late General Abdel Fattah
Younes who was shot death by Islamist-linked militia within the
anti-Gaddafi forces on 28th July, 2011 and after two days later my
mother with my two brothers was killed one early morning by the rebels
as result of civil war that going on in my country Libya. I am now
writing to seek for your assistance from Guinea Conakry where I
managed to escape nearby country through the help of United Nation
after the death of my parents, and now seeking asylum in Refugee Camp
here in Guinea Conakry.

Meanwhile, the main reason why I am seeking for your assistance is
because of some money my late father was deposited in one of the banks
here in Guinea in my name as his next of kin which amount is ($6.250M
USD).However, I have being advised by the bank manager to look for a
foreign partner who will stand as my trustee to claim the fund due to
my refugee status. And i will forward you with the necessary documents
on confirmation of your acceptance to assist me for the transfer and
statement of the fund in your country. As you will help me in an
investment, also it is my intention to compensate you with 40% of the
total money for your services and the balance shall be my capital in
your establishment.

Please get back to me if you are interesting by assisting me claim the
fund, so that I will give you all the details /contact of the bank
where the fund was deposited. Honestly I want the fund to be
transferred into your account before I come over your country to
continue my education,honestly I am really suffering since I arrived
in this country, it is too painful, but I hope with your help I will
have the fund transferred into your account to enable me to come over
to your country and have a better life to live in your country.

Happy to hear from you soon this is my e-mail adress
