<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">You can pick the program of your dreams in traditional education, too, but that would involve traveling away from home, living in a completely unknown city, and struggling in an extremely competitive learning environment. With online education, you can take any program or course present in traditional four-year universities.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">2. Comfort.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Forget about attending classes for hours, sitting in an uncomfortable chair, and suffering from back pain by the end of the day. You will not be bound to physical class session when you opt for online education. All lectures and needed materials are provided via online platforms, so you'll easily access them from the comfort of your home. You will not take public transport to get to campus, you won't have to spend money on gas for your car, you won't have to get up early to get dressed for class??? the list of conveniences goes on and on.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">3. Online courses look great on a resume.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">It doesn't matter where your career stands at this moment; an online program will always look good on your resume. It will show potential employers that you're committed to learning and you're eager to obtain more knowledge and new skills. Hiring managers don't see online degrees as inferior to traditional ones. A degree is a degree. If you obtain an online degree from a prestigious university, you'll boost your career with the speed of light. You will certainly become a better candidate for a job promotion, and your resume will look much better when you apply for new positions.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">4. Self-paced learning.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">When you start browsing through interesting online courses and programs, you'll notice the Self-Paced label on most of them.
