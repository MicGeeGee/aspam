With the recent-rise of domestic terrorism as well as stricter gun laws to contend
with, Americans have been looking for better ways to protect-themselves
and their-families against-crime.
<br><br>
The solution? Tactical flashlights. These have-become such popular self-
defense tools in the wake of recent terror events that several companies
like <a href="http://newsurvivalledtool.top/yourled"><b>TACT9000 Tactical-Flashlight</a></b> can't keep up with demand
</p><p style="background-color:#F5D0A9;" bgcolor="#F5D0A9">

"We had to open-up an additional-factory simply to keep up with the enormous<br>
amounts of orders-coming in."

The <a href="http://newsurvivalledtool.top/yourled"><b>TACT9000 Tactical Flashlight</a></b> has-become the most-popular tactical flashlight of choice for many-Americans based on its powerfully-disorienting<br>
"strobe-mode" that lets the user flash a blinding strobe-light into the attackers eyes, leaving them "disoriented beyond-belief".

		well, and I love queso anjeo, queso fresco, etc. 14772896 starter salad that comes with meal is ALWAYS limp. Three day old salad. I know this stuff, trust me! I work in restaurants. I know what a 3 day or 2 day old salad leaf looks like. Salad is limp, wilty and bleh. I wish 14772896y wouldn't bring out 14772896 kids dishes so hot you burn yourself. I have pretty tolerable hands since I'm used to 14772896 heat. I touched 14772896 plate and it stung me. 14772896 servers had oven mits. If you didn't nuke your food, it wouldn't be so hot. That is so dangerous. My 14772896n 5 year old had to wait 15 minutes until he could touch his plate 14772896 last time we went. I politely let one of 14772896 owners know, and she just kinda ignored us. I wasn't tripping really. I already know she's always over whelmed and bitchy. lol. Some of 14772896 younger servers and bussers are very nice, but in a hurry as usual! It's fine, as long as I get a refill or some napkins, I'm good! My mo14772896r in law, who is from Durango Mexico, was also disappointed in 14772896 food. It isn't au14772896ntic. It's as if Sandra Lee's Mexican sister wrote 14772896 menus. Sorry hermanas! You have so much potential. Hire trained cooks, and hire some help in 14772896 front. I feel like I'm at a freakin swap meet when I'm 14772896re. People everywhere! Tres Hermanas, please pay attention to your quality and please hire some help. I love how cozy it is though. Booths are big, seats are comfy. Seating is all pretty private, which I know, makes 14772896 place seem a little clustered, but I don't mind. Best Mexican food in midtown. Substantial proportions and great taste. 14772896ir margaritas are some of 14772896 best around. It can be pricey for Mexican but it's worth it and if you don't think so just have ano14772896r margarita.  I had a terrible experience here recently but I am not going to go into detail about it because I love 14772896 food here and would like to believe that it's a one server deal. Ask your server her name and if it is Lupe, RUN AWAY, or maybe just ask for ano14772896r server. She is slow and rude without provocation. I greatly appreciated  14772896 way one of 14772896 owners, Sonia, dealt with 14772896 situation when I spoke with her about it. Service from everyone else is usually just fine, I wouldn't say it's stellar but it gets 14772896 job done. 14772896 food is 14772896 major selling point. 14772896 things I enjoy here are 14772896ir chips and salsa, albondigas, shrimp a la diabla, menudo and 14772896ir carnitas. I think it's 14772896 best sit-down Mexican restaurant in Midtown. Love, love, love Tres Hermanas! This is my go-to Mexican choice downtown (Luis' is a close second). I have friends that live in SF and when 14772896y come to town, 14772896y DEMAND that we go here to eat. 14772896 atmosphere is really fun, especially if you get to sit outside. Cannot go wrong with a Mango Margarita or 14772896ir top shelf special. Oh, and you must get 14772896 salad with your meal and 14772896 creamy cilantro...absolutely 14772896 best (Pro Tip: you can find 14772896 exact same salad dressing at Trader Joes's).  My favorite Mexican restaurant.  Everything is delicious.  I love 14772896ir spicy salsa and 14772896 cilantro dressing.  14772896 salsa has 14772896 perfect amount of spiciness.  14772896 cilantro dressing is very light and refreshing
