I love this place.  Right next to the Cabela's structure.  We have been there many times.  After work in Wheeling, and on the way back to Pittsburgh, I stop... Totally awesome!  Recommended by someone at Cabelas \u0026 definitely worth the stop. Had the Steer sandwich with a side of au jus \u0026 it was amazing. Plan to stop... Came to visit West Virginia and came here for dinner since nothing else was open.  On a Sunday night it was very empty but he service was great. The whole... When traveling, I tend to avoid the chain restaurants. I mean, I can get to the majority of them in ten to fifteen minutes from my house. Since I was... Never had a bad meal here.

So yesterday while in the area we decided to try Olive Garden and use some of our gift... I am shocked and somewhat indifferent when it comes to how cheap it was to eat here.  I know it's a chain, and a lot of what is served is not top shelf... Loved it!! Both the sushi and Habachi were great, but the Habachi did have a lot of butter. This place is a great find!  It's right off the highway tucked away near a whole bunch of boring chain restaurants.   Here's what you need to know: ..- The... Absolutely the greatest family style place to eat..OMG what you get for $15.00: first you get home made sweet rolls and corn bread with Amish churned butter.... Top notch pizza! Funky vibe and friendly faces. Will continue to fill my pizza cravings at Scratch :)) This is my visit here at Cootie Browns, but probably not the last. Every time I say the name Cootie Brown's, I think of that 90's rap song by the infamous... Two words: true gem! ....For all these times I have been here, everything (food, service, etmosphere) always is consistently great. Because I moved to East TN... Gourmet \u0026 Co. is a true gem in Northeast Tennessee!....I was on a quest to find a restaurant in the Tri-Cities that served sustainably-sourced, New American...

First time coming here and we love it :) me and 3 friends rode our motorcycles here from Kingsport/Bristol and well worth the trip. Will be coming back here... Very cozy and casual, it is one of those places I love going to with absolutely zero-effort outfits and makeup (mainly none at alll). Food is inexpensive... Friendly, well trained staff from the minute you enter the door! Our server Dottie was very sweet and represented the restaurant and her manager well.
