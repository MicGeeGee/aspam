As this was an inane and unanswerable argument Benjamin made no reply and from that time on a chasm began to widen between them He dered what possible fascination she had ever exercised over him

To add to the breach he found as the new century gathered headway that his thirst for gaiety grew stronger Never a party of any kind in the city of Baltimore but he was there dancing with the prettiest of the young married women chatting with the most popular of the debutantes and finding their company charming while his wife a dowager of evil omen sat among the chaperons now in haughty disapproval and now follog him with solemn puzzled and reproachful eyes

Benjamin looked at him on the verge of tears

And another thing continued Roscoe when visitors are in the house I want you to call me Unclenot Roscoe but Uncle do you understand It looks absurd for a boy of fifteen to call me by my first name Perhaps youd better call me Uncle all the time so youll get used to it

With a harsh look at his father Roscoe turned away

At the termination of this interview Benjamin wandered dismally upstairs and stared at himself in the mirror He had not shaved for three months but he could find nothing on his face but a faint white down with which it seemed unnecessary to meddle When he had first come home from Harvard Roscoe had approached him with the proposition that he should wear eyegles and imitation whiskers glued to his cheeks and it had seemed for a moment that the farce of his early years was to be repeated But whiskers had itched and made him ashamed He wept and Roscoe had reluctantly relented

Benjamin opened a book of boys stories The Boy Scouts in Bimini Bay and began to read But he found himself thinking persistently about the war America had joined the Allied cause during the preceding month and Benjamin wanted to enlist but alas sixteen was the minimum age and he did not look that old His true age which was fiftyseven would have disqualified him anyway

There was a knock at his door and the butler appeared with a letter bearing a large official legend in the corner and addressed to Mr Benjamin on Benjamin tore it open eagerly and read the enclosure with delight It informed him that many reserve officers who had served in the SpanishAmerican War were being called back into service with a higher rank and it enclosed his commission as brigadiergeneral in the United States army with orders to report immediately

Benjamin jumped to his feet fairly quivering with enthusiasm This was what he had wanted He seized his cap and ten minutes later he had entered a large tailoring establishment on Charles Street and asked in his uncertain treble to be measured for a uniform
