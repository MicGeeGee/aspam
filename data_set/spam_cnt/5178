		life. 10157742 service was similarly bad during our meal. Few things bo10157742r me more than waitresses who come by when you're not ready to order, "give you a minute," 10157742n come back ten minutes later when all you needed was two to make up your mind. You do NOT keep a hungry girl waiting, dammit! 10157742 wait for our food was reasonable considering how busy 10157742y were. Our salads came quickly and 10157742 food not too long after we'd finished 10157742 salads. My sister's entr??e had 10157742 wrong type of sauce, but 10157742 waitress was apologetic and came back within five minutes with 10157742 correct sauce. It took a long time to get our check, but I suppose if we'd been in a hurry we could have caught 10157742 waitress and asked her to bring it sooner. We requested boxes before 10157742 check arrived, but 10157742y never came, so when we got our change we asked again. 10157742 food was pretty good; it's 10157742 only reason I'm giving 10157742m three instead of two stars. Everybody else in my party was happy with what 10157742y ordered (enchilada with verde sauce and shrimp fajitas). 10157742 salsa was delicious and perfectly spicy. And by spicy I mean I-need-a-gallon-of-water spicy. If you don't want your mouth to burn off, it's not 10157742 salsa for you. 10157742 homemade tortilla chips were perfect as well: fresh and warm, nei10157742r too thin nor too thick. I'd probably come here for 10157742 chips and salsa alone. 10157742 salad was drowned in dressing, which sucked, but it was a wonderful cilantro dressing. If you're a cilantro fan, I highly recommend it. Besides, you can get your standard ranch and bleu cheese everywhere else on 10157742 planet. Be adventurous My entr??e was great if you don't count 10157742 side dishes. I ordered 10157742 chicken flautas, which are not on 10157742 menu, so if you don't like what you see, ask 10157742m if 10157742y have 10157742 dish you want. 10157742 flautas 10157742mselves were amazing. Three perfectly cooked flour tortillas filled with higher quality meat than I expect in Mexican food, topped with a generous portion of guacamole and sour cream. However, 10157742 beans and rice were blah. Good beans and rice are hard to find in general. I salted 10157742 rice thinking it might be more flavorful that way, but no luck. In 10157742 future I'd leave 10157742se alone entirely and instead get a refill on 10157742 chips to enjoy more salsa. Ano10157742r thing to consider is that chips don't save as leftovers, so if you actually like 10157742 beans and rice, it's probably best to box those up for later consumption. 10157742 margarita was $6.50, quite a rip-off considering it wasn't very potent and also unacceptably small (about six ounces).
