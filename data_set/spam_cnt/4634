We were just passing through Norfolk and we were lucky to find this bistro on Yelp.  I enjoyed my avocado egg... The chorizo tacos, chile rellenos, rice, beans, and chips \u0026 salsa were all perfect.  And the horchata -- delicious!  Not to mention cheap! I love Leon's!  I am from Neligh, NE originally so I spent a lot of time in Norfolk.  My family and I LOVED eating at Leon's.  Now, my family has moved away... Good inexpensive big burritos!  Good horchata!  I love the veggie burrito, so good, even has avocado! Salsa/hot sauce is great!  Usually decently quick service I continue to be impressed with this shining star in a town with limited dining choices.  Yesterday my family and I enjoyed a hibachi dinner, and as usual... This is a gem in a small rural area!  The apps were great!  We stopped there because of the reviews on yelp after dropping our son off at the local... We've been going Friday nights and have enjoyed our food!  My husband loves the two 5 oz fillets and I've been trying their fish, which is different for me... We just had my daughter's and my nephew's birthday party.  Everything was great!!  There were 16 of us we all received excellent service!! French onion soup is great, spinach dip, good drink variety. Steaks and salads are great cooked to order. Will be back again!!! We stopped in Decatur for lunch at The Blue Spoon at 1:30 pm and found it closed. So I Yelped another place and found Paco's Sol Bistro. I'm  sooooo happy... It's distinctly better Chinese food.....I really have never disliked  any entree I've had here, but the Henan Chicken and General Tso Chicken are my... Yummy yummy yummy!!!....Been eating this since I was a kid. I always mean to try something new but the spaghetti and ravioli just call my name and I never... Compared to the other dining options in Decatur, I'm giving this place a 4 star rating. By no means is it phenomenal food, but it's definitely way better... Great Mexican food! Server was polite and brought us everything we needed and was quick doing it! We were taken good care of just wish the check was dropped...f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
