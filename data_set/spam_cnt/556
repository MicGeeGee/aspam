  The door slowly opened inward under his handand he looked into the room and said something A faint voice answered something Little more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side

  He looked back over his shoulderand beckoned them to enter Mr Lorry got his arm securely round the daughters waistand held her for he felt that she was sinking
