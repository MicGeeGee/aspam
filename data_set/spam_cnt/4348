Chapter  Summary
Johnny drives the wagon as the soldier named Private Turner we later find out his first name is Cush sits in it giving orders and playing with Johnnys greatgrandfathers sword They are driving toward a Union prison so Johnny begins to try to think of an escape plan He knows that if he is ed or locked in a prison his Ma and sisters are going to have a tough time surviving </span></td>

The conversation about reading leads to a conversation about the war Johnny says again that his Pa was fighting for states rights but Private Turner says that Johnnys Pa was fighting against the Constitution 

When they arrive at camp Johnny contemplates running again but he does not see an opportunity Private Turner says that he can get Johnny food if Johnny teaches him how to read Johnny is hungry enough that he agrees but he has the scheme of only pretending to teach Turner how to read and instead teaching him everything wrong

Chapter  Summary
At lunch the next day Turner demands his first reading lesson He hands Johnny a piece of paper with the Gettysburg Address written on it Johnny refuses to teach him how to read that When Johnny threatens to crumple up the piece of paper Turner gets angry That takes Johnny by surprise as he did not know that black people could have holy feelings about things 

Johnny starts to teach with the ABCs but it turns out that Turner already knows those He learned by hiding under a school house until he got caught and told to go home Johnny is surprised again that a black boy wanted to learn that bad 

As their conversation goes on Turner tells Johnny about the whippings they used to get back on the plantation and how it was not anything like getting whipped by your own Pa Before they can talk too much more lunch is over and it is time to get back on the road again 

Since Johnny knew he was taking a risk by teaching Turner wrong he decides to try to get out of it as much as possible He also realizes that his best chance at escaping is getting Turner to trust him so he tries to have as many conversations as possible They talk about the Declaration of Independence and church 
That night the teamster sleeping next to Johnny died in his sleep Chapter  Summary
As they continued along Johnny felt that he was beginning to earn the trust of Turner but not enough for him to go off on his own He continues to teach him some words wrong when they do reading lessons This is when Johnny f</span></td>
