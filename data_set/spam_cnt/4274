<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">1. Check Your Tread Depth<br />Tread depth is an important indicator of tire wear. Check your tread depth to determine if your need to replace your current tires.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">2. Check Your Tires for Damage and Wear<br />Be sure to check your tires for any signs of wear, such as discoloration or cracks.

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">What To Expect When Buying New Tires<br />The first thing you'll need when tire shopping is your tire size. Jot it down from your tire's sidewall. It may also be listed on the placard inside your driver's side door or in your owner's manual.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The make and model, as well as how you use the vehicle, are all important to selecting the right tire. Your tire choice may be different if you just drive around town, take frequent long trips or for driving both on- and off-road.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">You should also keep in mind what tire benefits are most important to you. You may want great wet traction, traction in snow, high-performance traction or off-road capability. The more specific you are, the better tire choice you can make.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">You may have several tire options. Our sales professionals can discuss the features and benefits of each tire to make sure you have confidence in the choice you make. Once you've settled on a set of tires you are happy with, it's time for the installation.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Installing New Tires<br />Once you select a tire, the installation process begins. This usually takes at least 30 minutes. There are several itemized services required to properly install your new tires, regardless of where you make your purchase. The following services are included in your installation:</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Removal and disposal of your old tires<br />Replacing the air valve stem on your wheels<br />Mounting the new tires onto your wheels<br />Balancing the tires to help reduce vibration and extend tread life<br />Buying tires is an important process, but it doesn't have to be intimidating.
