For single or widowed seniors, senior travel groups offer opportunities to meet others within their age range who hold similar interests. However, travel groups for seniors are much more than a way to meet people. They provide opportunities that cater to a wide range of interests from learning tours to adventure travel and volunteering opportunities.

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Learning Tours<br />For those who believe you're never to old to learn, or enjoy traveling to pursue an interest or hobby, learning tours provide unique travel experiences.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">For those on a limited budget, AARP suggests taking advantage of free walking tours found in a number of cities in the United States as well as overseas. These tours are led by locals who can provide interesting details that tourists won't hear elsewhere.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Senior Group Adventure Travel<br />Plenty of baby boomers ages 50 and over want to not only travel with a group of people within their age group, but also want their travels to be adventurous. This can include activities that are water-related, such as: kayaking, canoeing, fishing and rafting, or may include taking in the scenery with a hike, riding horseback or some other physical activity. The important thing to consider when traveling with a senior group on an adventure such as this is that you'll have to be in moderately good physical shape. You can find a number of resources that provide adventurous group travel for seniors.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Senior Volunteer Vacations<br />Many seniors volunteer in their communities, but not everyone is aware of the opportunities to volunteer while on vacation. A number of projects and agencies have a history of long-term projects perfect for seniors to contribute their skills and time while on vacation.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Finding the Right Travel Group<br />A number of factors should be taken into consideration when choosing the right travel group for you. First, if you want to travel with seniors, the first criteria will be to consider groups comprised of people 50 years and older. Second, you'll want to determine what is important to you as you travel. This can include things like your budget for the trip as well as what you want to do on your vacation and where you want to go.</p>
