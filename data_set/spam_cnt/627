 we had everything before uswe had nothing before uswe were all going direct to Heavenwe were all going direct the other way in shortthe period was so far like the present periodthat some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being receivedfor good or for evilin the superlative degree of comparison only

  There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain faceon the throne of England there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair faceon the throne of France In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishesthat things in general were settled for ever

  It was the year of Our Lord one  seven  and seventyfive Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured periodas at this Mrs Southcott had recently attained her fiveandtwentieth blessed birthdayof whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallog up of London and Westminster Even the Cocklane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of yearsafter rapping out its messagesas the spirits of this very year last past supernaturally deficient in originality rapped out theirs Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and Peoplefrom a congress of British subjects in America whichstrange to relatehave proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cocklane brood

  Franceless favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and tridentrolled with exceeding smoothness down hillmaking paper  and spending it Under the guidance of her Christian pastorsshe entertained herselfbesideswith such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut offhis tongue torn out with pincersand his body burned alivebecause he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his viewat a distance of some fifty or sixty yards It is likely enough thatrooted in the woods of France and Norwaythere were grog treeswhen that sufferer was put to already marked by the WoodmanFateto come down and be sawn into boardsto make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in itterrible in history It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paristhere were sheltered from the weather that very dayrude cartsbespattered with rustic miresnuffed about by pigsand roosted in by poultrywhich the Farmerhad already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution But that Woodman and that Farmerthough they work unceasinglywork silentlyand no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread the ratherforasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awakewas to be atheistical and traitorous

  In Englandthere was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting Daring burglaries by armed menand highway robberiestook place in the capital itself every night families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers warehouses for security the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the lightandbeing recognised and challenged by his fellowtradesman whom he stopped in his character of the Captaingallantly shot him through the head and rode away the mail was waylaid by seven robbersand the guard shot three and then got shot  himself by the other fourin consequence of the failure of his ammunition after which the mail was robbed in peace that magnificent potentatethe Lord Mayor of Londonwas made to stand and deliver on Turnham Greenby one highwaymanwho despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeysand the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among themloaded with rounds of shot and ball thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court dragrooms musketeers went into St Gilessto search for contraband goodsand the mob fired on the musketeersand the musketeers fired on the moband nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way In the midst of themthe hangmanever busy and ever worse than uselesswas in constant requisition nowstringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals nowhanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday nowburning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozenand now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall todaytaking the life of an atrocious murdererand tomorrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmers boy of sixpence

  All these thingsand a  like themcame to pass in and close upon the  old year one  seven  and seventyfive Environed by themwhile the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheededthose two of the large jawsand those other two of the plain and the fair facestrod with stir enoughand carried their divine rights with a high hand Thus did the year one  seven  and seventyfive conduct their Greatnessesand myriads of small creaturesthe creatures of this chronicle among the restalong the roads that lay before them
