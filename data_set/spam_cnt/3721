Fellow Woodworking Enthusiast:  

I get asked over and over again, "What's the best way to start a woodworking project?". 

I have spent the last 4 years collecting more than 16,000 project plans to make your woodcraft projects fool-proof. 

I designed each plan with easy-to-follow, step-by-step directions that you can't mess up. These projects are ideal for weekend woodworkers and skilled craftsmen.

"Of all the woodwork kits I have bought over the years, this is the best collection I have. Its an excellent resource for beginners as well as seasoned woodworkers. It includes tons of blueprints for different small crafts, furniture and outdoor projects and it???s simply outstanding...an excellent investment for anyone starting out.
 
I would loved to have had these when I was building my first outdoor deck. Considering the excellent content, and the quality of the plans itself, this package is quite a bargain." - Melvin Jones AWFS Association, Lake Ariel PA
