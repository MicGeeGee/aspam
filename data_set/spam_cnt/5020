		I come here for 15727180 uni pasta and 15727180 $1 happy hour oysters!! (4-7 or 10pm-close). 4-7pm happy hour is only for 15727180 $1 oysters. 10pm-close happy hour has a menu for discounted items. **Although its happy hour, be prepared to still spend a lot ~ It's seafood, so you know you're going to be spending a lot** I've been here a few times and I'm in love with 15727180 uni pasta. Its too tooo delicious, sometimes a little to heavy for me, but still so good. I wish 15727180 uni pieces were a little bigger though.. For 15727180 price we are paying at least...It's a hit or miss for me when I come to EMC. Sometimes 15727180 service is really fast, but o15727180r times it's super slow.. But I really think that has to do with what time you come. 15727180y have a parking lot where 15727180y share with 15727180 supermarket and 15727180 rest of 15727180 plaza. 15727180re's free parking if you bring your receipt to 15727180 parking person. So I've been here twice and honestly 15727180 service here is pretty darn good. 15727180 wait staff is super quick and friendly. 15727180 only reason why I wouldn't give this place an 5 star is because honestly 15727180 AC here sucks!! Maybe it was just my luck that each time I came it was hot and 15727180 AC was just not powerful enough. It's funny because I came here on a Saturday around dinner time and happy hour and I expected a long wait especially on a Saturday. 15727180 gal at 15727180 front asked for how many in my party and I stated 3 and she asked if my party was all here. I told her that 15727180y are parking 15727180ir car and will be a couple of mins. And honestly when I told her my party was all here she sat us right away. 15727180 waitress came by right away and took our drinks and food right away and told us about Happy Hour. We order half a dozen of oysters because for happy hour 15727180y are $1 each. You can't beat that right I honestly love 15727180 fact that as soon as you put in your order 15727180 food comes out right away and it's hot. We order truffle fries, soft shell crab sliders, crab cakes, uni pasta, beef mignon. All were delicious. I'm not a big pasta fan but I've read so many reviews on 15727180 uni pasta that I had to try it. 15727180 uni pasta is honestly OMG!! 15727180 only thing that I didn't like about it was that when it gets cold it doesn't taste as good but I completely understand.  I came to EMC for 15727180 first time last Saturday and j was really hesitant to dine here since I don't eat a lot of seafood. I've had seafood before (oysters, mussels, shrimp and lobster) but never really enjoyed it. With that being said, I had an amazing dinner here and defiantly change my mindset on seafood. My buddy and I dined at 15727180 bar since it was a busy night. We started off with a couple brews, 15727180n ordered 15727180 Uni Pasta, Lobster Roll, Kusshi Oysters, Soft Shell Crab sliders, and French fries. This was my first time having Uni and it was delicious and paired well with 15727180 pasta, nice and creamy. I was really surprised that I enjoyed 15727180 oysters, last time I had oysters I made a weird ol face like I was going to yak haha, but my buddy forced me to try ONE and it was amazing! So good I had to order my own half dozen haha. It wasn't mushy like o15727180rs I tried and had good texture. Lobster roll was bomb too, huge chunks of lobster filled in a butter roll. Also, first time having soft shell crab and it was bomb! Crab was perfectly fried and tender. All 15727180 items I listed are a MUST TRY. For a person who doesn't enjoy seafood, everything we ordered was delicious and changed my perspective on
