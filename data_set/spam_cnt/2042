Really a unique and amazing restaurant in New Richmond...Not your usual fare. So many varieties of interesting HEALTHY food.  ..I highly recommend a stop... I thought this would be a semi decent hole in the wall- I was wrong! From the menu to the service, this special treat of a restaurant is absolutely... One of the best places I've ever eaten. The decor sucks but with food that good who cares. The service was friendly, and the food was delicious. Need I say more? Will definitely be stopping here again. The prices were great and the portions were huge! We were visiting a friend in WI over the weekend, and our friend recommended we head down to St. Croix Falls and try Loggers for lunch.we decided to head... Found myself in Stillwater and asked a local where they recommend for lunch. Lolo's was recommended for their tacos so we decided to give the place a try.... Ditto on the smoke.
