University Study Discovers Enzyme to Regrow Hair 
==========================================

New Information Regarding Hair Thinning for:
 bruce@untroubled.org,

If you are experience thinning or hair loss, this is for you.

Just 2 months ago David McKenna was too self-conscious to leave his home without a cap on...

He was shunned by every woman he approached...

His shiny bald head made him feel embarrassed. 

But then something changed.

Through the help of an unconventional doctor, David discovered a remarkable, but powerful tip to reverse his hair loss, and shockingly about 3 months later, he had a full head of hair. Now David is the one rejecting the women.

It was all thanks to the discovery of an 'odd' enzyme.  Best of all, anyone, men or women, can use this enzyme to regrow gorgeous, full, healthy hair.
