The film industry is still one in which you don't necessarily need a college degree in order to start a career. If you are talented, tenacious, and you impress the right people, you can still start out as a gofer, best boy, or script girl and end up directing or producing movies before long. In truth, there are a slew of advantages to be gained when you begin your foray into the cinematic arts with a degree from a notable institution of higher learning. Here are just a few benefits you'll enjoy with a film degree under your belt.

<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;">In the film industry, you don't necessarily need a college degree to get started.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: helvetica;">However, if you want to start higher than a position in which your job is to fetch coffee for everyone on set, then you need to consider film school.</span></p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Explore the many facets of film. There are several ways you can go when it comes to a career in the film industry. On the one hand, there is the production aspect, which could include producing and directing tracks, as well as technical work on set. And then there is post-production, where all the magic of editing and computer generated images (CGI) takes place. Distribution is also essential. And of course, there are screenwriters and the actors who bring their lines of dialogue to life, casting agents that select the proper actors for films, accountants that manage the money trail, lawyers to create contracts, and so on and so forth. The college experience will allow you to explore the many different options available to you before you decide how you want your film career to progress.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Become an expert. Once you've found your preferred niche within the film industry, you can focus your studies to become an expert at the job you've chosen. This could mean honing your skills at screenwriting, technical directing, cinematography, editing, computer animation, sound mixing, or any number of other disciplines. But when you are knowledgeable about the latest technology and techniques and you have a firm understanding of your craft, you're much more likely to impress the people who are seeking your skillset.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Apply for internships. Of all the benefits you may gain during your time in college, perhaps the most important is your access to internship opportunities. Film is an industry where getting your foot in the door is no easy feat. If you can nab an internship (or several) during your time in film school you have a much greater chance of meeting people who have the power to help you find work following graduation.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Build a resume. You'll no doubt participate in all manner of projects during your time on campus, either for class or independently. And the more you can add to your portfolio or demo reel, the better prepared you'll be to show your skills and experience when you start seeking jobs.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Network. Film is an industry in which who you know is just as important as what you know, and film school gives you the opportunity to meet the filmmakers of tomorrow and put their info in your contact list. Whether you attend the International Academy of Film and Television, the UCLA or USC film school, or a less prestigious institution, building a strong network of contacts is essential to your success down the road.</p>
