  As he bent his head in his most courtly mannerthere was a secrecy in his smiling faceand he conveyed an air of mystery to those wordswhich struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly At the same timethe thin straight lines of the setting of the eyesand the thin straight lipsand the markings in the nosecurved with a sarcasm that looked handsomely diabolic

  Yesrepeated the Marquis A Doctor with a daughter Yes So commences the new philosophy You are fatigued Good night

  It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his The nephew looked at himin vainin passing on to the door

  Good night said the uncle I look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning Good repose Light Monsieur my nephew to his chamber thereAnd burn Monsieur my nephew in his bedif you willhe added to himselfbefore he rang his little bell againand summoned his valet to his own bedroom
