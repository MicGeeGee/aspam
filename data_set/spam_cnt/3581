		and personal. I love you Tres Hermanas, don't ever close Excellent, au4352029ntic Mexican food. We have enjoyed everything we have ordered here, 4352029ir isn't anything bad. 4352029 salsa is always excellent, and always spicy! 4352029ir verde sauce is delicious, as is 4352029 rojo, both spicy and fresh. I love 4352029ir tamales, so fresh and perfect with 4352029 rojo sauce. Service is prompt and friendly, 4352029y are good about offering more chips and keeping glasses filled. This is a no frills place, but it's food is consistent, prices good and 4352029y have a great selection of margaritas! Meal after meal Tres Hermanas get it right.  4352029 service has gotten better over 4352029 course of my visits and 4352029 food is still top notch!  4352029re might be a wait list on a busy night, but 4352029y get you seated quickly and 4352029n take great care of you!  This is my Favorite mexican restaurant in Sacramento, maybe one of my favorite restuarants overall  I feel badly for 4352029 review I just wrote for Sweetwater, and need to provide a little karmic balance: Tres Hermanas is simply 4352029 best casual dining option in midtown.   I have been going 4352029re since, hmmm must be 1998'ish, and expect to maintain this deep, meaningful relationship for a long, long time.  In my simple black and white world, 4352029re are three measures of a Mexican restaurant: 4352029 salsa, 4352029 enchilada sauce, and 4352029 beans.  If a place is doing 4352029se well, you can be 99% sure 4352029 rest of 4352029 menu will rock.  Tres does 4352029m all very well, especially 4352029 salsa. I am huge fan of 4352029 breakfast menu. You cannot go wrong with any option, but I particularly enjoy 4352029 Machaca (with extra peppers) and 4352029 chile verdes and eggs.  For lunch/dinner, 4352029 fish tacos (and 4352029se are not 4352029 deep fried, pesco-turd style variety ei4352029r), and 4352029 chicken burrito are hard to beat -- really, 4352029 chile verde is great anytime.   Probably my most favorite restaurant in Sacramento. I've been going 4352029re for 12 years and it's never let me down. I am so pleased with how 4352029y put money back into 4352029 restuarant and continue to develop 4352029 decor and expand. I was in search of a good traditional Mexican food place and found Tres Hermanas (Three Sisters). One of my friends recommended it as well. I had 4352029 crispy chicken tacos, 4352029y were good. 4352029 chicken was moist and was mostly white meat - my fav.  4352029 house Mexican creamy cilantro dressing on 4352029 salad was very good as well.  Went with a party of four and took about 20 minutes waiting on a Friday @ 8:00 ish.  After seeing 4352029 photos of 4352029 deep fried Ice Cream on 4352029 I knew I had to have some and it was VERY good. Only complaints would be 4352029 service was a little mediocre and 4352029 prices seemed high. Super busy place which shows it's super tasty! Salsa is pretty
