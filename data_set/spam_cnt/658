<tt style="font-size:9px">he keeper of the eshop stopped to strike the wall with his handand mutter a tremendous curse No direct answer could have been half so forcible Mr Lorrys spirits grew heavier and heavieras he and his two companions ascended higher and higher

  Such a staircasewith its accessoriesin the older and more crowded parts of Pariswould be bad enough now butat that timeit was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unened senses Every little habitation within the great foul nest of one high buildingthat is to saythe room or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircaseleft its own heap of refuse on its own landingbesides flinging other refuse from its own dows The uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engenderedwould have polluted the aireven if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities the two bad sources combined made it almost insupportable Through such an atmosphereby a steep dark shaft of dirt and poisonthe way lay Yielding to his own disturbance of mindand to his young companions agitationwhich became greater every instantMr Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest Each of these stoppages was made at a doleful gratingby which any languishing good airs that were left uncorruptedseemed to escapeand all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in Through the rusted barstastesrather than glimpseswere caught of the jumbled neighbourhood and nothing within rangenearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of NotreDamehad any promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations

  At lastthe top of the staircase was gainedand they stopped for the third time There was yet an upper staircaseof a steeper inclination and of contracted dimensionsto be ascendedbefore the garret story was reached The keeper of the eshopalways going a little in advanceand always going on the side which Mr Lorry tookas though he dreaded to be asked any question by the young ladyturned himself about hereandcarefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over his shouldertook out a key

  The door is locked thenmy friend said Mr Lorrysurprised

  Ay Yeswas the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge

  I think it necessary to turn the key Monsieur Defarge whispered it closer in his earand frowned heavily
