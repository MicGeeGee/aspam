  The accusedwho was and who knew he was being mentally hangedbeheadedand quarteredby everybody thereneither flinched from the situationnor assumed any theatrical air in it He was quiet and attentive watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before himso composedlythat they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which it was strewn The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with vinegaras a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever

  Over the prisoners head there was a mirrorto throw the light down upon him Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in itand had passed from its surface and this earths together Haunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have beenif the glass could ever have rendered back its reflectionsas the ocean is one day to give up its  Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace for which it had been reservedmay have struck the prisoners mind Be that as it maya change in his position making him conscious of a bar of light across his facehe looked up and when he saw the glass his face flushedand his right hand pushed the herbs away

  It happenedthat the action turned his face to that side of the court which was on his left About on a level with his eyesthere satin that corner of the Judges benchtwo persons upon whom his look immediately rested so immediatelyand so much to the changing of his aspectthat all the eyes that were turned upon himturned to them
