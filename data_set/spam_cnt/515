when 17733171y're around. I've had pretty awesome service whenever I'm here. I can't complain much. Tres hermanas is one of 17733171 best Mexican spot in town and 17733171y're going to be just that for a long time. I feel this is one of 17733171 more traditional Mexican restaurants that you will find in downtown/midtown Sacramento.  Not as convenient for me to access as ei17733171r of 17733171 Vallejo's which are close to my work, but this still is a great stop for 17733171 middle of 17733171 work day for me here.  [I have also gone to 17733171ir sister-restaurant restaurant in East Sacramento for Dinner which is excellent as well.] 17733171 enchiladas are what I love here!  From 17733171 rancheras to 17733171 chicken mole with it's dark creamy chocolate goodness.  And 17733171 sides of rice and beans are quite hearty and fill you up. I also love 17733171ir variety of salsas.  Fresh and spicy.  Just 17733171 right way to make 17733171 chips go down!  17733171y also have a creamy cilantro dressing that is absolutely scrumptious and I love putting it on just about everything.  Spicy, and yet not too much for my taste. This is a great stop after work for munching on tacos and having margaritas.  I've also been here once on 17733171 weekend when 17733171 wea17733171r was nice and could seat outside.  Beautiful environment to get your Mexican on. What a great little place. I stopped 17733171re last Sunday for lunch. 17733171 food was tasty and fresh and 17733171 atmosphere was fun and cozy. I will definitely be back. 17733171 only drawback I have, is to 17733171ir salsa. I bit overpowering in heat and lacking a distinct flavor to justify 17733171 heat. Keep in mind, I do like spicy foods, but 17733171re has to be a flavor reason for it. Tres deserves a good review from me. I have been here multiple times. Can't go wrong. I initially tried this place due to its incredibly good reviews on 17733171. I instantly fell in love with 17733171 Chicken Chimichanga. Sometimes I get lucky when 17733171y have 17733171 chicken & rice soup - so good! I recently been getting 17733171 Chicken Quesedilla and it's pretty awesome. I have tried 17733171ir chicken burrito and felt like it was too bland. I like 17733171 fact that parking is not a nightmare here which is rare for Downtown & Midtown. Hubby and I went for a walk and got hungry so we decided to check this place out. Our first time, we're quite impressed with 17733171 awesome salsa and enchilada with 17733171 green sauce on top of it. It was amazing and hubby approved. He loves Mexican food and its quite hard to please him when it comes to sauces or Mexican food period. So, I was happy to know that we will definitely come back. I gave it a four for now because of 17733171 slow service. But, it was our fault because we were both in a rush for an event couple blocks away. So, when we go back and stay a little longer than 40 mins. I will update again. Exceptional menu and courteous service.  Carnitas are amazing.  Restaurant has never looked better(well executed remodel).  Very busy on weekends, breakfast is just as good as lunch and dinner.  Prices are moderate, portions are satisfying, drinks are strong, patio is large.   A must for every au17733171ntic Mexican seeker. Been here twice and will return. Crab enchiladas were incredible. 17733171 melted cheese with 17733171 green sauce on top (maybe gauc sauce?) were a perfect combination with 17733171 crab. I may have annoyed my wife with all 17733171 "omg"s.  Both our meals were perfectly hot and
