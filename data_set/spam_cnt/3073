Pa goes through phases where he starts to feel better but ultimately his condition worsens -->

<br><br>
After burying Pa Johnny has to get back to work in order for the family to survive the ter He runs into Jeb a fellow teamster who informs him that a wagon train is taking supplies up to Richmond The pay is good but Johnny is worried that it might be dangerous enough that it would count as breaking his promise to Pa Jeb tries to convince him it will be safer by informing him that Mosbys Rangers will be riding along to protect them Colonel Mosby was famous for riding around Virginia attacking Union troops That makes Johnny feel a bit better but he is still uncertain until the Major told him it is his duty to go along 
<br><br>
Convinced Johnny tries to tell his Ma that there will be no danger With  Mosbys along and the promise of  he is ultimately able to convince his Ma to let him go though deep down he still feels that his Pa would not approve Chapter  Summary
Johnny heads out for his teamster work after hitching the mules to the wagon and preparing them for the trek He takes his greatgrandfathers sword with just in case they run into trouble He also takes along a book of psalms

Johnny gets to the teamster camp in the woods after dark They have to wait there for a couple of days to allow everyone to assemble so he settles in for the night with his mules He meets some of the other teamsters and talks to them enough to learn that they are not the brightest bunch He is also ridiculed for thinking that a sword would do any good against Union gunfire

<!--Johnny is able to get a lot of teamster work since the Union troops stole the wagons and horses of many other farms It was not as much food or supplies as he used to carry for those same farms but he is happy to have any work at all
