   <p>Tactical LED Flashlight<br /> Marie looked up at his defiant figure a=
nd her face clouded. &quot; I wish you weren' t so restless, and didn' t ge=
t so worked up over things,&quot; she said sadly. &quot; Thank you,&quot; h=
e returned shortly. She sighed despondently. &quot; Everything I say makes =
you cross, don' t it? And you never used to be cross to me.&quot; Emil took=
 a step nearer and stood frowning down at her bent head. He stood in an att=
itude of self-defense, his feet well apart, his hands clenched and drawn up=
 at his sides, so that the cords stood out on his bare arms. &quot; I can' =
t play with you like a little boy any more,&quot; he said slowly. &quot; Th=
at' s what you miss, Marie. You' ll have to get some other little boy to pl=
ay with.&quot; He stopped and took a deep breath. Then he went on in a low =
tone, so intense that it was almost threatening: &quot; Sometimes you seem =
to understand perfectly, and then sometimes you pretend you don' t. You don=
' t help things any by pretending. It' s then that I want to pull the corne=
rs of the Divide together. If you WON' T understand, you know, I could make=
 you!&quot; Marie clasped her hands and started up from her seat. She had g=
rown very pale and her eyes were shining with excitement and distress. &quo=
t; But, Emil, if I understand, then all our good times are over, we can nev=
er do nice things together any more. We shall have to behave like Mr. Linst=
rum. And, anyhow, there' s nothing to understand!&quot; She struck the grou=
nd with her little foot fiercely. &quot; That won' t last. It will go away,=
 and things will be just as they used to. I wish you were a Catholic. The C=
hurch helps people, indeed it does. I pray for you, but that' s not the sam=
e as if you prayed yourself.&quot; She spoke rapidly and pleadingly, looked=
 entreatingly into his face. Emil stood defiant, gazing down at her. &quot;=
 I can' t pray to have the things I want,&quot; he said slowly, &quot; and =
I won' t pray not to have them, not if I' m damned for it.&quot; Marie turn=
ed away, wringing her hands. &quot; Oh, Emil, you won' t try! Then all our =
good times are over.&quot; &quot; Yes; over. I never expect to have any mor=
e.&quot; Emil gripped the hand-holds of his scythe and began to mow. Marie =
took up her cherries and went slowly toward the house, crying bitterly. IX =
On Sunday afternoon, a month after Carl Linstrum' s arrival, he rode with E=
mil up into the French country to attend a Catholic fair. He sat for most o=
f the afternoon in the basement of the church, where the fair was held, tal=
king to Marie Shabata, or strolled about the gravel terrace, thrown up on t=
he hillside in front of the basement doors, where the French boys were jump=
ing and wrestling and throwing the discus. Some of the boys were in their w=
hite baseball suits; they had just come up from a Sunday practice game down=
 in the ballgrounds. Amedee, the newly married, Emil' s best friend, was th=
eir pitcher, renowned among the country towns for his dash and skill. Amede=
e was a little fellow, a year younger than Emil and much more boyish in app=
earance; very lithe and active and neatly made, with a clear brown and whit=
e skin, and flashing white teeth. The Sainte-Agnes boys were to play the Ha=
stings nine in a fortnight, and Amedee' s lightning balls were the hope of =
his team. The little Frenchman seemed to get every ounce there was in him b=
ehind the ball as it left his hand. &quot; You' d have made the battery at =
the University for sure, ' Medee,&quot; Emil said as they were walking from=
 the ball-grounds back to the church on the hill. &quot; You' re pitching b=
etter than you did in the spring.&quot; Amedee grinned. &quot; Sure! A marr=
ied man don' t lose his head no more.&quot; He slapped Emil on the back as =
he caught step with him. &quot; Oh, Emil, you wanna get married right off q=
uick! It' s the greatest thing ever!&quot; Emil laughed. &quot; How am I go=
ing to get married without any girl?&quot; Amedee took his arm. &quot; Pooh=
! There are plenty girls will have you. You wanna get some nice French girl=
, now. She treat you well; always be jolly. See,&quot; --he began checking =
off on his fingers,--&quot; there is Severine, and Alphosen, and Josephine,=
 and Hectorine, and Louise, and Malvina--why, I could love any of them girl=
s! Why don' t you get after them? Are you stuck up, Emil, or is anything th=
e matter with you? I never did know a boy twenty-two years old before that =
didn' t have no girl. You wanna be a priest, maybe? Not-a for me!&quot; Ame=
dee swaggered. &quot; I bring many good Catholics into this world, I hope, =
and that' s a way I help the Church.&quot; Emil looked down and patted him =
on the shoulder. &quot; Now you' re windy, ' Medee. You Frenchies like to b=
rag.&quot; But Amedee had the zeal of the newly married, and he was not to =
be lightly shaken off. &quot; Honest and true, Emil, don' t you want ANY gi=
rl? Maybe there' s some young lady in Lincoln, now, very grand,&quot; --Ame=
dee waved his hand languidly before his face to denote the fan of heartless=
 beauty,--&quot; and you lost your heart up there. Is that it?&quot; &quot;=
 Maybe,&quot; said Emil. But Amedee saw no appropriate glow in his friend' =
s face. &quot; Bah!&quot; he exclaimed in disgust. &quot; I tell all the Fr=
ench girls to keep ' way from you. You gotta rock in there,&quot; thumping =
Emil on the ribs. When they reached the terrace at the side of the church, =
Amedee, who was excited by his success on the ball-grounds, challenged Emil=
 to a jumping-match, though he knew he would be beaten. They belted themsel=
ves up, and Raoul Marcel, the choir tenor and Father Duchesne' s pet, and J=
ean Bordelau, held the string over which they vaulted. All the French boys =
stood round, cheering and humping themselves up when Emil or Amedee went ov=
er the wire, as if they were helping in the lift. Emil stopped at five-feet=
-five, declaring that he would spoil his appetite for supper if he jumped a=
ny more. Angelique, Amedee' s pretty bride, as blonde and fair as her name,=
 who had come out to watch the match, tossed her head at Emil and said:-- &=
quot; ' Medee could jump much higher than you if he were as tall. And anyho=
w, he is much more graceful. He goes over like a bird, and you have to hump=
 yourself all up.&quot; &quot; Oh, I do, do I?&quot; Emil caught her and ki=
ssed her saucy mouth squarely, while she laughed and struggled and called, =
&quot; ' Medee! ' Medee!&quot; &quot; There, you see your ' Medee isn' t ev=
en big enough to get you away from me. I could run away with you right now =
and he could only sit down and cry about it. I' ll show you whether I have =
to hump myself!&quot; Laughing and panting, he picked Angelique up in his a=
rms and began running about the rectangle with her. Not until he saw Marie =
Shabata' s tiger eyes flashing from the gloom of the basement doorway did h=
e hand the disheveled bride over to her husband. &quot; There, go to your g=
raceful; I haven' t the heart to take you away from him.&quot; Angelique cl=
ung to her husband and made faces at Emil over the white shoulder of Amedee=
' s ball-shirt. Emil was greatly amused at her air of proprietorship and at=
 Amedee' s shameless submission to it. He was delighted with his friend' s =
good fortune. He liked to see and to think about Amedee' s sunny, natural, =
happy love. He and Amedee had ridden and wrestled and larked together since=
 they were lads of twelve. On Sundays and holidays they were always arm in =
arm. It seemed strange that now he should have to hide the thing that Amede=
e was so proud of, that the feeling which gave one of them such happiness s=
hould bring the other such despair. It was like that when Alexandra tested =
her seed-corn in the spring, he mused. From two ears that had grown side by=
 side, the grains of one shot up joyfully into the light, projecting themse=
lves into the future, and the grains from the other lay still in the earth =
and rotted; and nobody knew why. X While Emil and Carl were amusing themsel=
ves at the fair, Alexandra was at home, busy with her account-books, which =
had been neglected of late. She was almost through with her figures when sh=
e heard a cart drive up to the gate, and looking out of the window she saw =
her two older brothers. They had seemed to avoid her ever since Carl Linstr=
um' s arrival, four weeks ago that day, and she hurried to the door to welc=
ome them. She saw at once that they had come with some very definite purpos=
e. They followed her stiffly into the sitting-room. Oscar sat down, but Lou=
 walked over to the window and remained standing, his hands behind him. &qu=
ot; You are by yourself?&quot; he asked, looking toward the doorway into th=
e parlor. &quot; Yes. Carl and Emil went up to the Catholic fair.&quot; For=
 a few moments neither of the men spoke. Then Lou came out sharply. &quot; =
How soon does he intend to go away from here?&quot; &quot; I don' t know, L=
ou. Not for some time, I hope.&quot; Alexandra spoke in an even, quiet tone=
 that often exasperated her brothers. They felt that she was trying to be s=
uperior with them. Oscar spoke up grimly. &quot; We thought we ought to tel=
l you that people have begun to talk,&quot; he said meaningly. Alexandra lo=
oked at him. &quot; What about?&quot; Oscar met her eyes blankly. &quot; Ab=
out you, keeping him here so long. It looks bad for him to be hanging on to=
 a woman this way. People think you' re getting taken in.&quot; Alexandra s=
hut her account-book firmly. &quot; Boys,&quot; she said seriously, &quot; =
don' t let' s go on with this. We won' t come out anywhere. I can' t take a=
dvice on such a matter. I know you mean well, but you must not feel respons=
ible for me in things of this sort. If we go on with this talk it will only=
 make hard feeling.&quot; Lou whipped about from the window. &quot; You oug=
ht to think a little about your family. You' re making us all ridiculous.&q=
uot; &quot; How am I?&quot; &quot; People are beginning to say you want to =
marry the fellow.&quot; &quot; Well, and what is ridiculous about that?&quo=
t; Lou and Oscar exchanged outraged looks. &quot; Alexandra! Can' t you see=
 he' s just a tramp and he' s after your money? He wants to be taken care o=
f, he does!&quot; &quot; Well, suppose I want to take care of him? Whose bu=
siness is it but my own?&quot; &quot; Don' t you know he' d get hold of you=
r property?&quot; &quot; He' d get hold of what I wished to give him, certa=
inly.&quot; Oscar sat up suddenly and Lou clutched at his bristly hair. &qu=
ot; Give him?&quot; Lou shouted. &quot; Our property, our homestead?&quot; =
&quot; I don' t know about the homestead,&quot; said Alexandra quietly. &qu=
ot; I know you and Oscar have always expected that it would be left to your=
 children, and I' m not sure but what you' re right. But I' ll do exactly a=
s I please with the rest of my land, boys.&quot; &quot; The rest of your la=
nd!&quot; cried Lou, growing more excited every minute. &quot; Didn' t all =
the land come out of the homestead? It was bought with money borrowed on th=
e homestead, and Oscar and me worked ourselves to the bone paying interest =
on it.&quot; &quot; Yes, you paid the interest. But when you married we mad=
e a division of the land, and you were satisfied. I' ve made more on my far=
ms since I' ve been alone than when we all worked together.&quot; &quot; Ev=
erything you' ve made has come out of the original land that us boys worked=
 for, hasn' t it? The farms and all that comes out of them belongs to us as=
 a family.&quot; Alexandra waved her hand impatiently. &quot; Come now, Lou=
 Stick to the facts. You are talking nonsense. Go to the county clerk and =
ask him who owns my land, and whether my titles are good.&quot; Lou turned =
to his brother. &quot; This is what comes of letting a woman meddle in busi=
ness,&quot; he said bitterly. &quot; We ought to have taken things in our o=
wn hands years ago. But she liked to run things, and we humored her. We tho=
ught you had good sense, Alexandra. We never thought you' d do anything foo=
lish.&quot; Alexandra rapped impatiently on her desk with her knuckles. &qu=
ot; Listen, Lou. Don' t talk wild. You say you ought to have taken things i=
nto your own hands years ago. I suppose you mean before you left home. But =
how could you take hold of what wasn' t there? I' ve got most of what I hav=
e now since we divided the property; I' ve built it up myself, and it has n=
othing to do with you.&quot; Oscar spoke up solemnly. &quot; The property o=
f a family really belongs to the men of the family, no matter about the tit=
le. If anything goes wrong, it' s the men that are held responsible.&quot; =
&quot; Yes, of course,&quot; Lou broke in. &quot; Everybody knows that. Osc=
ar and me have always been easy-going and we' ve never made any fuss. We we=
re willing you should hold the land and have the good of it, but you got no=
 right to part with any of it. We worked in the fields to pay for the first=
 land you bought, and whatever' s come out of it has got to be kept in the =
family.&quot; Oscar reinforced his brother, his mind fixed on the one point=
 he could see. &quot; The property of a family belongs to the men of the fa=
mily, because they are held responsible, and because they do the work.&quot=
; Alexandra looked from one to the other, her eyes full of indignation. She=
 had been impatient before, but now she was beginning to feel angry. &quot;=
 And what about my work?&quot; she asked in an unsteady voice. Lou looked a=
t the carpet. &quot; Oh, now, Alexandra, you always took it pretty easy! Of=
 course we wanted you to. You liked to manage round, and we always humored =
you. We realize you were a great deal of help to us. There' s no woman anyw=
here around that knows as much about business as you do, and we' ve always =
been proud of that, and thought you were pretty smart. But, of course, the =
real work always fell on us. Good advice is all right, but it don' t get th=
e weeds out of the corn.&quot; &quot; Maybe not, but it sometimes puts in t=
he crop, and it sometimes keeps the fields for corn to grow in,&quot; said =
Alexandra dryly. &quot; Why, Lou, I can remember when you and Oscar wanted =
to sell this homestead and all the improvements to old preacher Ericson for=
 two thousand dollars. If I' d consented, you' d have gone down to the rive=
r and scraped along on poor farms for the rest of your lives. When I put in=
 our first field of alfalfa you both opposed me, just because I first heard=
 about it from a young man who had been to the University. You said I was b=
eing taken in then, and all the neighbors said so. You know as well as I do=
 that alfalfa has been the salvation of this country. You all laughed at me=
 when I said our land here was about ready for wheat, and I had to raise th=
ree big wheat crops before the neighbors quit putting all their land in cor=
n. Why, I remember you cried, Lou, when we put in the first big wheat-plant=
ing, and said everybody was laughing at us.&quot; Lou turned to Oscar. &quo=
t; That' s the woman of it; if she tells you to put in a crop, she thinks s=
he' s put it in. It makes women conceited to meddle in business. I shouldn'=
 t think you' d want to remind us how hard you were on us, Alexandra, after=
 the way you baby Emil.&quot; &quot; Hard on you? I never meant to be hard.=
 Conditions were hard. Maybe I would never have been very soft, anyhow; but=
 I certainly didn' t choose to be the kind of girl I was. If you take even =
a vine and cut it back again and again, it grows hard, like a tree.&quot; L=
ou felt that they were wandering from the point, and that in digression Ale=
xandra might unnerve him. He wiped his forehead with a jerk of his handkerc=
hief. &quot; We never doubted you, Alexandra. We never questioned anything =
you did. You' ve always had your own way. But you can' t expect us to sit l=
ike stumps and see you done out of the property by any loafer who happens a=
long, and making yourself ridiculous into the bargain.&quot; </p>=20
