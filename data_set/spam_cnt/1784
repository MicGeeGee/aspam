New Study Finds Cure for Herpes Virus

Herpes Sufferer bruce@untroubled.org,

I've had a severe herpes infection for over 5 years.

I've tried all the herpes therapies you can think of, including all the herbs, Famvir, even the ridiculously expensive ozone.

What has brought me the most relief -- and I mean no more symptoms -- and not a trace of the virus in my body -- is this therapy.

It has also taken care of the neuralgia associated with the infection and sickening side effects of medications.

Best of all, it's so simple and inexpensive.  I costs less than a dollar-a-day.

To a Herpes-Free Life,

Marcus W.
(former herpes sufferer)

P.S. Being herpes-free has changed my life!
