Was very enjoyable. Stopped in for lunch and had a great salad and sandwich. I had the prime rib salad which was excellent.   It's was not inexpensive.... I'm in town visiting from California and have had two good experiences here.  I've found the servers to be friendly and efficient and the quality to be very... Great find!   Glad we looked for restaurants on Yelp or we might not have found this little gem.  It's not on a main road. ....Vinny is friendly and his food... How anyone can give anything less than 5 stars is beyond me. The food is excellent. The freshness is out of this world. The owners are so friendly and hard... Incredible treat. Will be a regular when I move I love this place! They only reason I give it 4 stars is because it looks a bit old, and no one seemed to know how to logon to the wifi. The food was great.... Great spot! We were in town for a wedding and happenedf8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

Great spot! We were in town for a wedding and happened to meet the owner so he invited us in for dinner. We both had the filet special and it was delicious.... Tristan our server was great! Service,food\u0026brews were great! Get in the door at 5pm on the dot and you will get great service, food\u0026no wait! Nice atmosphere... We have been coming for Bigfork for years. This was our best meal yet. Quality food at great pricing. Knowledgeable, skilled and friendly staff. Everything... This place blows Fogo de Choa (former favorite Brazilian steakhouse and still delicious) out of the water. I came here for my 7th wedding anniversary and... ....and that ladies and gentleman, is how it's done. Mood, meal, value, service. Spot on. ....To be completely honest, I didn't think restaurants like this... I had been here with two colleagues for dinner...We had ribs, pasta and steak.....Food: Pretty good. Certainly one of the better restaurants in T.....Location:... Service was friendly and the food was great.  We went at about 4 on a Sunday and we're surprised it was filling up by 5, so take the reservations suggestion... Two egg and sausage and a cheesesteak omelette!..Both with the HOMEMADE BREAD!! ..Delicious, fast service, friendly staff. ..Can't wait to come back! ....Right... Best place to eat in the area. Incredible cheese plates and great homemade pastas. I don't know where to begin!I never expected to find a gourmet dining experience not focused on pizza on the Old Forge-Duryea border...  This place had one... I love the Tioga Bistro. I've been there for lunch and breakfast. The food is great and it's a very nice relaxed atmosphere. Tunkhannock in general is such... Nice, homey diner with great chocolate chip pancakes. It was incredibly small (only one room) but the service was fast, and the food was hot and delicious.......f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047</span></td>
