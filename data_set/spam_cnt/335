<a style="color:rgba(246,246,246,1); visibility:hidden" href="http://latou.filledpointsaccount.com">Here cried Benjamin desperately Read this And he thrust his commission toward the colonel The colonel read it his eyes popping from their sockets Whered you get this he demanded slipping the document into his own pocket I got it from the Government as youll soon find out You come along with me said the colonel with a peculiar look Well go up to headquarters and talk this over Come along The colonel turned and began walking his horse in the direction of headquarters There was nothing for Benjamin to do but follow with as much dignity as possiblemeanwhile promising himself a stern revenge But this revenge did not materialise Two days later however his son Roscoe materialised from Baltimore hot and cross from a hasty trip and escorted the weeping general sans uniform back to his home

In  Roscoe ons first  was born During the attendant festivities however no one thought it the thing to mention that the little grubby boy apparently about ten years of age who played around the house with lead soldiers and a miniature circus was the new babys own grandfather

No one disliked the little boy whose fresh cheerful face was crossed with just a hint of sadness but to Roscoe on his presence was a source of torment In the idiom of his generation Roscoe did not consider the matter efficient It seemed to him that his father in refusing to look sixty had not behaved like a redblooded hemanthis was Roscoes favourite expressionbut in a curious and perverse manner Indeed to think about the matter for as much as a half an hour drove him to the edge of insanity Roscoe believed that live wires should keep young but carrying it out on such a scale waswaswas inefficient And there Roscoe rested

Five years later Roscoes little boy had grown old enough to play ish games with little Benjamin under the supervision of the same nurse Roscoe took them both to kindergarten on the same day and Benjamin found that playing with little strips of coloured paper making mats and chains and curious and beautiful designs was the most fascinating game in the world Once he was bad and had to stand in the cornerthen he criedbut for the most part there were  hours in the cheerful room with the sunlight coming in the dows and Miss Baileys kind hand resting for a moment now and then in his tousled hair

Roscoes son moved up into the first grade after a year but Benjamin stayed on in the kindergarten He was very happy Sometimes when other tots talked about what they would do when they grew up a shadow would cross his little face as if in a dim ish way he realised that those were things in which he was never to share

The days flowed on in monotonous content He went back a third year to the kindergarten but he was too little now to understand what the bright shining strips of paper were for He cried because the other boys were bigger than he and he was afraid of them The teacher talked to him but though he tried to understand he could not understand at all

owner and like other slave owners a politician he was naturally an original secessionist and ardently devoted to the Southern cause Circumstances of an imperious nature which it is unnecessary to relate here had prevented him from taking service with that gallant army which had fought the disastrous campaigns ending with the fall of Corinth and he chafed under the inglorious restraint longing for the release of his energies the larger life of the soldier the opportunity for distinction That opportunity he felt would come as it comes to all in wartime Meanwhile he did what he could No service was too humble for him to perform in the aid of the South no adventure to perilous for him to undertake if consistent with the character of a civilian who was at heart a soldier and who in good faith and without too much qualification ented to at least a part of the frankly villainous dictum that all is fair in love and war</a>
