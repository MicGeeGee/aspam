<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Herpes Sufferer bruce@untroubled.org,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">I've had a severe herpes infection for seven years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">I've tried all the herpes therapies you can think of, including all the herbs, Zovirax, even the ridiculously expensive ozone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">What has brought me the most relief -- and I mean no more symptoms -- and not a trace of the virus in my body -- is this treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">It has also taken care of the neuralgia associated with the infection and sickening side effects of medications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Best of all, it's so simple and inexpensive. It costs less than what a week's supply of acyclovir costs.</span></p>
