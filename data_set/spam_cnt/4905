Two types of surface coatings are conventional liquid paint and a powder coating.  I am going to focus more on the liquid paint, but will touch briefly on the powder coating.  Some surface coatings are based on synthetic polymers that include paints, drying oils and varnishes, synthetic clear coatings, and other products whose primary function is to protect the surface of an object from the environment.

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Surface coatings are available in a brilliant clear coat, but also come in numerous colors as well as styles, such as a decorative flake coating.<br />- The first thing to consider is, are you using the coating in a residential, commercial, or industrial capacity?<br />- What type of surface are you applying the coating to?<br />The type of surface will determine if you want a liquid base (wood decks and veranda's, and concrete garage floors) or powder coating (metal siding, pipes, and automobiles).<br />Let's focus on residential use for the remaining steps. Let's say you have a deck and a garage floor that you want to apply a protective coating to. For a wood deck, you may want to choose a liquid paint in either a cocoa, dark brown, or a burgundy color. The exact color would be based on the type of wood.<br />For a patio floor, whether it's a flat gray or stamped concrete, you could choose a concrete grey liquid paint, or even a clear coat. If you are just looking to protect the patio from the elements, you could go with the grey paint option. But if your patio is a stamped concrete or even some kind of stone work, then you will more likely want to choose the clear coat so the natural texture continues to stand out.<br /> <br />Applying Your Surface Coating<br />Preparation - For any surface you are going to apply your sealant to, the first step is to completely clean the surface of any dust and debris. You may use a broom or some type of wet-dry vacuum to thoroughly clean the surface. In some instances a cleaning agent or a pressure washer may be necessary, so be sure the surface is completely dry before applying your new protective coating.<br />Mixing - Some surface coatings, such as aid based coatings, will have mixing instructions. This may go without saying, safety first. Follow the instructions precisely and always wear protective eye wear and clothing, such as gloves, to protect your skin.<br />Application - Liquid paint surface coaters can be applied using standard paint rollers and brushes, where power coatings may require the use of a pressure sprayer. Refer to product instructions for drying time, recommended number of coatings, as well as recommended wait time before allowing foot traffic.</p>
