They were discussing moral courage in AP English when the topic about Tommie Smith and what he did during the  Olympics was brought up He is Danielles father and Little asked Danielle to invite her father to come in to class to give a talk The follog Friday Tommie Smith dropped by Crenshaw Sadi was asked to recite a poem that he wrote when he got inspired by the footage of Tommies feat during the 
 Olympics Latisha was then asked to introduce Tommie He then delivered an empowering speech and answered questions in front of everybody 

Tommie Smith had always put emphasis on education when it comes to encouraging her daughter Danielle as he himself strived  to obtain an education when he was young man His emphasis for education sometimes frustrated Danielle She wanted to be track star at Crenshaw but her father didnt give her any encouragement She inherited her fathers desire to be the very best at everything
