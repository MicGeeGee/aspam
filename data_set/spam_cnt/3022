17608099 waitress. Sorry and I don't want to be cruel, but our waitress needs to tone it down a lot and 17608099 food would have even tasted better. Some people complain in 17608099ir reviews that 17608099 prices here are too high and I won't do that as I think 17608099y are within 17608099 fair rage, but just by a hair. 17608099 food tastes great, but 17608099 presentation sucks and that is part of 17608099 dining experience.  17608099y need to be reading 17608099se reviews and I am sure no one at Tres Hermanas is doing that. Too bad as forums like "17608099" will be making or breaking places to eat for many years to come. First tried this place back in September 0f 2012 and fell in love. Best margaritas and have yet to have a bad meal. I suggest green enchiladas, crispy chicken tacos, caldo, whole pinto beans, and chicken Caesar salad. Although I am not big on dessert, 17608099 waitress made a suggestions and I was a taker. She was right, too. Prices are fair and did not leave a dimple on my wallet, only left a dimple on my love for delicious Mexican food with warm atmosphere.   Even though I am from 17608099 Fresno area, I never bat an eye when looking for outstanding Mexican food in Sacramento.  My girlfriend loves 17608099 chile, drinks, tequila selection, and Mole enchiladas. I can't keep her away from this place and she enjoys 17608099 friendly feel you are in 17608099 bar area. Bartender is very knowledgeable about alcohol and makes some grand drinks I LOVE everything about Tres Hermanas from 17608099y're amazing decor (beautifully restored old eclectic door frames partition seating areas), friendly staff and excellent food. I seriously recommend 17608099 carnitas, 17608099y are 17608099 best in 17608099 crispy taco and thinking about 17608099m makes me want to leave, NOW, and go get some! Lunch is quick. You'll have to wait at least 30 minutes for dinner... get over it! If you step out of line, 17608099re will be many an eager a person ready to replace you. 17608099 meal is worth it. 17608099y're salsa is one of my favorites... nice and spicy. As if everything above isn't enough to go 17608099re, 17608099y have a huge outdoor patio area with fans in 17608099 summer and heat lamps in 17608099 winter. 17608099y have seating for small and large parties both inside and out. After getting this far... why haven't you left yet? Go, go now and maybe i'll see you 17608099re! We love eating here. Great food and margaritas. It gets pretty busy on 17608099 weekends, so we try to get 17608099re before 6pm and never have to wait to be seated. 17608099y are fast with service and have always gotten our order correct. No complaints here! 17608099 food at this place is absolutely delish! 17608099 margaritas are a little pricey but 17608099 tequila options are very good. I had a Cajun seafood pasta that was fantastic! 17608099 chips and salsa are good, not great but definitely tasty. I agree with previous reviewer that salsa should not contain large pieces of onion.  We came for lunch on Sunday afternoon. 17608099 restaurant wasn't packed like usual, but 17608099re was a small crowd. We were seated right away. Our waitress bought out chips & salsa and water before taking our order too. 17608099 service
