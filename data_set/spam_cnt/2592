19359420 restaurant with.  It also helps that 19359420 workers are fabulous.  19359420y are really nice, fill up your water at every pass, make sure that you are doing well, etc.  I like that.  I like being taken care of and I love good food. 19359420 chicken was succulent.  19359420 cheese was oozalicious (I know it's not a word but 19359420re really isn't any "real" words to describe 19359420 greatness of 19359420se dishes).  19359420 tacos were definitely crispy and flavorful.  19359420 salad with 19359420 cilantro dressing made me want to lick 19359420 plate and savor every last drop.  I would suck 19359420 salad leaves if that would make my dressing last longer.  Maybe next time I should ask for more salad but 19359420n 19359420re may not be enough room in my stomach for my entree.  Oh well, 19359420re are sacrifices to be made. Even 19359420 chips and salsa are addicting.  Be prepared to finish 19359420 chips and salsa and not even know it.  If anything, just blame it on  your friend and ask for more! No matter what you order, if 19359420re is sauce to be chosen, order 19359420 verde sauce.  It has 19359420 right amount of kick to it as well as being flavorful. Don't take it from me but if you do, come in, enjoy your friends, have a margarita or two or three, eat and be merry.  Because, you will definitely have food coma a few minutes after you are done with your meal.  Some people call it crack but I call it a sleep aid because when you're done, all you are going to want to do is take a nap. OK, 19359420 ambiance is definitely 19359420 best at like, Zocalo, but if you're looking for 19359420 real deal when it comes to cuisine, this is where I'd recommend. Tres Hermanas is how Mexican is supposed to be -- nothing fancy, super big portions, etc. Hopefully you're in Midtown so you can ride your bike or stroll over, because 19359420 parking sitch kinda -- but what can you do, it's to be expected, I suppose. And that's honestly 19359420 only thing I can complain about! Yeah, sometimes it gets busy and 19359420 wait times get bogged down, but it's a testament to how delicious and popular TH is. Everything I've ordered has been delicious. I think 19359420 enchiladas might be my fav. Obvi 19359420 margs. Anywhere that gives me chips and salsa right when I sit down gets major bonus points. Oh, and when 19359420y ask soup or salad? You want salad with 19359420 creamy cilantro dressing. You're welcome. Came here early on a Saturday night for 19359420 first time with a small group and seated ourselves on 19359420 patio. Once we got 19359420 attention of 19359420 waitress, she quickly brought out menus and chips and salsa for 19359420 table and took our drink orders right away. We ordered a pitcher of cadillac margaritas. 19359420 margaritas were flavorful and not too sweet; lime and tequila seemed to be 19359420
