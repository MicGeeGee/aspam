But when it's just for one night, that puts extra pressure on... Stopped here after a long 8 mile hike at Effigy Mounds, the reviews were good \u0026 we kept our fingers crossed they were right - they were! This place was... the food is always good, and the service, but the place looks dirty, and greasy, u wonder if the inspector has ever been there....also we had a coupon they... Happened across this when looking for a getaway from Chicago for our first anniversary weekend and it was the perfect choice! Not only did it get us clear... I was traveling through and wanted to eat at a local establishment. I enjoyed the deluxe skillet with sausage and my boyfriend ordered the meat eater... I haven't been a fan of Chinese food until I tried their beef and broccoli. The restaurant is usually pretty empty and quiet. It's worth a shot! Driving into Prairie du Chien at 9:30pm, we were hoping something other than a fast food restaurant would be open. We found this restaurant on YELP. Great... The manager hooked me up with free food during my cross country bike ride! Someone cleaned out my bank account and I didn't have any money. He was so great! You can still order your meal from your car, but we never do. That just increases the chance of my truck looking like a pig sty! ....I have the same thing... really good food and great service. BUT, this place is tiny. there's probably like 6 tables altogether. we got the matador combo which is good for two... Chef Vinny Accardi might have cooked in Hell's Kitchen, but you are dining in Heaven's Kitchen at his restaurant!....All jokes aside, this is the second time... This was a date!  I haven't been out in a while, so this was a great choice.  The hilarious thing was that I was actually hoping to go to Marani, but for... Jaegerschnitzel- red cabbage - spaetzle...House beer \u0026 Warsteiner Pilsner...Waitstaff (Meghan) OUTSTANDING!..A must stop if in Queens. Old world charm, damn... Excellant!!! From Pizza to any of their Entrees - u can't go wrong... My all time favorite is the Calamari Barosa in red sauce. Definitely a masterpiece.... Very chill on Thursday afternoon. ....Some Russian friends suggested that I try the meat dolma, I've only ever had the ones with rice and other veggies... Best Mexican food around, hands down. The chef there knows what he is doing. Food is always fresh, tasty and served traditionally, seasoning is very... Great little place. Loved the pizza margherita and the pasta was aldente.....Great service too! This diner never ceases to amaze me, and it's food is one of the things I am going to miss most when j go off to college. Yes, that's just how good this...f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
