 Oh If that was beginning it said Mr Lorry

  It wasnt ending itI suppose I saywhen you began itit was  enough not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manetteexcept that he is not worthy of such a daughterwhich is no imputation on himfor it was not to be expected that anybody should beunder any circumstances But it really is doubly and trebly  to have crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him I could have forgiven himto take Ladybirds affections away from me

  Mr Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealousbut he also knew her by this time to bebeneath the service of her eccentricityone of those unselfish creaturesfound only among womenwho willfor pure love and admirationbind themselves willing slavesto youth when they have lost itto beauty that they never hadto accomplishments that they were never fortunate enough to gainto bright hopes that never shone upon their own sombre lives He knew enough of the world to know that there is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart so rendered and so  from any mercenary tainthe had such an exalted respect for itthat in the retributive arrangements made by his own mindwe all make such arrangementsmore or lesshe stationed Miss Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably better got up both by Nature and Artwho had balances at Tellsons

  There never wasnor will bebut one man worthy of Ladybirdsaid Miss Pross and that was my brother Solomonif he hadnt made a mistake in life

  Here again Mr Lorrys inquiries into Miss Prosss personal history had established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessedas a stake to speculate withand had abandoned her in her poverty for evermorewith no touch of compunction Miss Prosss fidelity of belief in Solomon deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake was quite a serious matter with Mr Lorryand had its  in his good opinion of her

  As we happen to be alone for the momentand are both people of businesshe saidwhen they had got back to the dragroom and had sat down there in friendly relationslet me ask youdoes the Doctorin talking with Lucienever refer to the shoemaking timeyet
