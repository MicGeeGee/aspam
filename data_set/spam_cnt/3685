Delicious dinner and fantastic customer service from everyone that worked there even at 8:30 on a Monday night! Thank you Benz for even bagging up my left...

It's definitely not a fancy place LOL.....With that said, the salad bar was fair, the prime rib dinner on Saturday... Where else can you get fresh, buttery salmon that evanesces with flavor?....This place has been a favorite of mine ever since they opened up on campus a few... I grew up in Urbana and have been here several times for lunch and dinner (hello salad bar!).  BUT, I came home to visit my family this week and was meeting...

My husband and I had our rehearsal dinner here in March. The service and food were impeccable. Very impressed!....We started off with bruschetta and bacon... The food makes me feel like I'm home.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
