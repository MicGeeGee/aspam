you wrap it yourself. It also came with this egg wrapped cheese and jalape??o thing that I personally didn't enjoy, but my sister thought it was good. I prefer crunchy jalape??os versus soggy, and I'm not a fan of eating cheese like that. My sister got this dish with green sauce and it was good! I forgot if she had enchilada or tamale, but look for any dish that has green sauce and try it.  I've been to multiple Tres Hermanas locations but I always seem to have an issue with this one. 9618969 food is still tasty, but things could be improved. For instance, my crab enchilada had an entire piece of crab leg in it. 9618969 piece was about 2 inches long, big enough that it should have been noticed when putting it into 9618969 enchilada. 9618969re were also hard tiny pieces of 9618969 crab throughout. 9618969 dish was tasty but it seems like 9618969y don't really care when it comes to taking apart 9618969 crabs and making 9618969 dishes. 9618969 o9618969r issue last night was our server. He was an older gentleman, and was nice and attentive enough (except for when we were both finished, waiting for about 10 mintues before anyone even took our plates or offered boxes/dessert [which we were NOT offered]/9618969 check), but he offered to split our plates (mine and my boyfriend's) so that we could share each o9618969r's dishes, without us mentioning that we wanted to do something like that. I ordered a specific dish because it uses corn tortillas (I can't eat wheat) and I like 9618969 sauce. My boyfriend ordered something completely different that I did not want. Not only did we say "no, thank you," but we had to say it multiple times. It was like he thought he was 9618969 host for Love Connection, even though my boyfriend and I have been toge9618969r for well over two years. We know what we want to order and eat, thank you. This is 9618969 spot to bring your family and friends from out of town. I don't usually eat 9618969 Mexican rice but I do here. Whenever I have 9618969 chance to eat here you can find me eating with poor habits. I'm using my fingers and raising my fork held high so I can engulf 9618969 ooozing cheese from my order. To cool things off or I should say to get things started we always order a pitcher of margaritas! It doesn't matter 9618969 kind you order as 9618969y are all of good quality and taste. As for 9618969 meat 9618969re is none that shows up any of 9618969 o9618969rs from carne asada, carnitas, or chicken. 9618969 mole sauce had 9618969 perfect blend of chocolate. Maybe I'm spoiled by o9618969r places I've been to but I decided I wanted to check this place out because I heard it's one of 9618969 better places in Sacramento. 9618969 food was good but I was disappointed by 9618969 Huevos Rancheros. 9618969y seemed very plain and 9618969 ranchero sauce was not what I expected. 9618969 food wasn't "bad" so to speak, but it was not what I expected at all. I don't know if my expectations were just too high or what. For a place downtown 9618969 atmosphere was very secluded and I felt like I was packed into
