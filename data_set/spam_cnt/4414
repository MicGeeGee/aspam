NYU Study Finds Cure For Herpes
Trial No. 22202179

Herpes Sufferer bruce@untroubled.org,

I've had a severe herpes infection for seven years.

I've tried all the herpes therapies you can think of, including all the herbs, MMS, even the ridiculously expensive ozone.

What has brought me the most relief -- and I mean no more symptoms -- and not a trace of the virus in my body -- is this remedy.

It has also taken care of the other symptoms associated with the infection and sickening side effects of medications.

Best of all, it's so simple and inexpensive.  It costs 66 times less than acyclovir.

To Your Health,

Marcus W.
(former herpes sufferer)

P.S. Being herpes-free has changed my life!
