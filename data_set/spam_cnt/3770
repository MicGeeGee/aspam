Scientific Breakthrough - "Miracle" Enzyme Reverses Baldness 
==========================================

New Information Regarding Hair Loss for:
 bruce@untroubled.org,

If you are experience thinning or hair loss, this is for you.

Just 2 months ago David McKenna was too embarrassed to leave his home without a cap on...

He was shunned by the woman he approached...

His shiny bald head made him feel self-conscious. 

But then something changed.

Through the help of an non-traditional doctor, David discovered a remarkable, but powerful tip to reverse his hair loss, and surprisingly about 3 months later, he had a full head of hair. Now David is the one rejecting the women.

It was all thanks to the discovery of an 'odd' enzyme.  Best of all, anyone, men or women, can utilize the power of this enzyme to regrow beautiful, thick, healthy hair.
