	<p style="width: 550px; font-size: 10px; text-align: justify; color: #ECECEC">What I supposeMr StryverI claim to characterise for myselfAnd understand mesirsaid Mr Lorryquickly flushing againI will notnot even at Tellsonshave it characterised for me by any gentleman breathing

  There I beg your pardon said Stryver

  Granted Thank you WellMr StryverI was about to sayit might be painful to you to find yourself mistakenit might be painful to Doctor Manette to have the task of being explicit with youit might be very painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you You know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with the family If you pleasecommitting you in no wayrepresenting you in no wayI will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon it If you should then be dissatisfied with ityou can but test its soundness for yourself ifon the other handyou should be satisfied with itand it should be what it now isit may spare all sides what is best spared What do you say

  How long would you keep me in town

  Oh It is only a question of a few hours I could go to Soho in the eveningand come to your chambers afterwards

  Then I say yessaid Stryver I t go up there nowI am not so hot upon it as that comes to I say yesand I shall expect you to look in tonight Good morning

  Then Mr Stryver turned and burst out of the Bankcausing such a concussion of air on his passage throughthat to stand up against it bog behind the two countersrequired the utmost remaining strength of the two ancient clerks Those venerable and feeble persons were always seen by the public in the act of bogand were popularly believedwhen they had bowed a customer outstill to keep on bog in the empty office until they bowed another customer in

  The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than moral certainty Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to swallowhe got it down And nowsaid Mr Stryvershaking his forensic forefinger at the Temple in generalwhen it was downmy way out of thisisto put you all in the wrong

  It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tacticianin which he found great relief You shall not put me in the wrongyoung ladysaid Mr Stryver Ill do that for you
