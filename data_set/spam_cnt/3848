		empty, you'll get your food in a reasonable time. 23999180 ladies serving are really friendly and frequently check on you to make sure things are good. If you like menudo, I recommend coming here. I also really like 23999180 machaca, meat mixed with egg. Chips and salsa are always good!  And when 23999180 wea23999180r is right, 23999180 outdoor seating is really nice!! Sunday dinner was surprisingly packed inside. You don't realize 23999180 extent of 23999180 length of 23999180 restaurant until you actually have to use 23999180 banos. It was a tad chilly by 23999180 door, but 23999180y had 23999180 heater on. 23999180 interior is reminiscent of a cantina with old world wood with decay and 23999180 straw mats on 23999180 ceiling as accents. Background music was au23999180ntic Mexican Spanish music which even I picked out one of my favorite singers, Laura Pausinni. It took quite awhile for service to come to our table, even with several eye contacts from everyone at 23999180 table and wait staff, like 30 minutes. 23999180 waitress was patient enough with me to explain what "Albondigas"  is. Our table was a party of 5. I didn't know it at 23999180 time but 23999180 chips and salsa are complementary. Nice. 23999180 salsa has a slight heat that kicks in after 23999180 first few bites. 23999180 chips 23999180mselves, are most evident of probably why 23999180y have secured so many years of being 23999180 best non chain Mexican restaurant in Sacramento. You can definitely tell 23999180se are made fresh and fried in 23999180 kitchen. Light, no greasy and a nice crunch to 23999180m. It's almost like a granola crunch in your mouth when you bite into it. I had 23999180 Camarones del de Diabla. This is my test of au23999180nticity with Mexican restaurants. It's basically shrimp in a spicy red sauce with sauteed onions and bell peppers. It comes with a order of salad of 23999180 side. 23999180 salad was a little skimpy. I recalled it almost to ordering a hamburger and hold 23999180 beef and buns.  23999180 pile was made up of green leaf lettuce, just enough to cover 23999180 salad plate, a hint of micro diced tomatoes, and blu cheese dressing. Not taking away from 23999180 freshness of 23999180 flavor or 23999180 quality of 23999180 green leaf instead of ice berg lettuce, 23999180 flavors were wonderful. I just wished 23999180re was more of it, like maybe a second layer? 23999180 re-fried beans were fresh and tasty. Usually, I pass on this. 23999180 rice was also very fresh and flavorful. It boasted an aroma that see23999180d across 23999180 plate beyond 23999180 shrimp and red sauce. It was moist and succulent, with no dried crunchy rice from hours ago. 23999180 main staple, 23999180 Devils Shrimp was hot. Spicy. I've had my share of this from many places up and down Mexifornia, and this was "Thai Hot." I was sweating and tossing back doubles on my iced Coke just to keep 23999180 heat down, but DAMN it was good. 23999180 server appeared intermittently and never failed to refill our drinks. From what I hear, 23999180 peach Margaritas are pretty good. Maybe next time we should eat in 23999180 back near 23999180 kitchen and not so far away from 23999180 service and warm air of 23999180 kitchen. If you go here, it should be for 23999180 chips and salsa alone. But 23999180re are o23999180r dishes you should try. I will.
