  Our family our honourable familywhose honour is of so much account to both of usin such different ways Even in my fathers timewe did a world of wronginjuring every human creature who came between us and our pleasurewhatever it was Why need I speak of my fathers timewhen it is equally yours Can I separate my fathers tbrotherjoint inheritorand next successorfrom himself

   has done that said the Marquis

  And has left meanswered the nephewbound to a system that is frightful to meresponsible for itbut powerless in it seeking to execute the last request of my dear mothers lipsand obey the last look of my dear mothers eyeswhich implored me to have mercy and to redress and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain

  Seeking them from memy nephewsaid the Marquistouching him on the  with his forefingerthey were now standing by the hearthyou will for ever seek them in vainbe assured

  Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his facewas cruellycraftilyand closely compressedwhile he stood looking quietly at his nephewwith his snuffbox in his hand Once again he touched him on the as though his finger were the fine point of a small swordwith whichin delicate finessehe ran him through the bodyand said,

  My friendI will dieperpetuating the system under which I have lived

  When he had said ithe took a culminating pinch of snuffand put his box in his pocket

  Better to be a rational creaturehe added thenafter ringing a small bell on the tableand accept your natural destiny But you are lostMonsieur CharlesI see

  This property and France are lost to mesaid the nephewsadly I renounce them

  Are they both yours to renounce France may bebut is the property It is scarcely worth mentioning butis it yet

  I had no intentionin the words I usedto claim it yet If it passed to me from youtomorrow
