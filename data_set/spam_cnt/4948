A diagnosis of COPD is not the end of the world. Most people have mild forms of the disease for which little therapy is needed other than smoking cessation. Even for more advanced stages of disease, effective therapy is available that can control symptoms, reduce your risk of complications and exacerbations, and improve your ability to lead an active life.

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Smoking cessation</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The most essential step in any treatment plan for COPD is to stop all smoking. It's the only way to keep COPD from getting worse - which can eventually reduce your ability to breathe. But quitting smoking isn't easy. And this task may seem particularly daunting if you've tried to quit and have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Talk to your doctor about nicotine replacement products and medications that might help, as well as how to handle relapses. It's also a good idea to avoid secondhand smoke exposure whenever possible.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Medications</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Doctors use several kinds of medications to treat the symptoms and complications of COPD. You may take some medications on a regular basis and others as needed.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Lung therapies</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Doctors often use these additional therapies for people with moderate or severe COPD:</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Oxygen therapy. If there isn't enough oxygen in your blood, you may need supplemental oxygen. There are several devices to deliver oxygen to your lungs, including lightweight, portable units that you can take with you to run errands and get around town. Some people with COPD use oxygen only during activities or while sleeping. Others use oxygen all the time. Oxygen therapy can improve quality of life and is the only COPD therapy proven to extend life. Talk to your doctor about your needs and options.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Managing exacerbations</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Even with ongoing treatment, you may experience times when symptoms become worse for days or weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation, and it may lead to lung failure if you don't receive prompt treatment.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Surgery</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Surgery is an option for some people with some forms of severe emphysema who aren't helped sufficiently by medications alone</p>
