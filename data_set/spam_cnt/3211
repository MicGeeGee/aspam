Things You Can Do to Keep Your Brain Focused
===================================

Brain Power Information for bruce@untroubled.org,

Have you ever thought about what it would be like to have a crystal clear
mind 24 hours a day from the minute you wake up, till the moment you go to sleep?

No more forgetting things ...

No more embarrassing "senior moments" ...

And no more "brain fog" that clouds your judgment and creates confusion.

Just a clear head with "rapid fire" thoughts and memory recollection as fast as flicking on a light switch.

Well, thanks to the remarkable work of a 103 year old veteran, the fantasy has become a reality for over 39,144 people worldwide.

And yes... He's over 100... but you wouldn't know it by talking to him.  He is as bright, interesting and alert as a man in his twenties.
