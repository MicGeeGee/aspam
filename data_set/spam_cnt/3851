      <td width="23%" style="color:#CACACA; font-size:6.1px">Dally returns and starts taunting the girls again Cherry throws her drink on him Dally will not stop bothering the girls until Johnny intervenes on their behalf When Johnny tells him to stop Dally stalks off and does not come back Cherry tells Ponyboy that she and her friend Marcia left their boyfriends because the boys were drunk The girls ask Ponyboy and Johnny to sit with them TwoBit arrives before the movie is over sneaks up on the group and frightens Johnny Cherry is surprised by the strength of Johnnys reaction until Ponyboy tells her that Johnny was jumped by a group of Socs a few months before

After the movie TwoBit convinces the girls to let him give them a ride home As they are walking to TwoBits car a Mustang full of Socs pulls up Bob Sheldon and Randy Anderson Cherry and Marcias boyfriends plead with the girls to come with them and stop walking with the bums TwoBit takes offense at the comment Cherry and Marcia agree to go with Bob and Randy in order to prevent a fight Before Cherry leaves she tells Ponyboy not to take it personally if she does not talk to him at school on Monday Ponyboy understands They are not in the same social cl and they never will be Cherry also tells Ponyboy that she hopes she never sees Dally again because she will fall for him if she does

      <td style="color:#CACACA; font-size:6.1px" width="23%">TwoBit leaves Ponyboy and Johnny continue walking home but stop at a vacant lot down the street to talk about meeting the girls They wish that they lived in a place not divided into Greasers and Socs where everyone is just plain and ordinary The boys fall asleep in the vacant lot Johnny wakes Ponyboy and tells him that he is going to stay in the lot instead of going home Ponyboy realizes he has missed his curfew and rushes home

When Ponyboy gets home Darry is still awake worried and angry Ponyboy tries to explain but Darry is tired of his excuses When Soda tries to stick up for Ponyboy Darry yells at him Ponyboy defends Soda The argument comes to an abrupt end when Darry slaps Ponyboy in the face It is the first time Darry has used physical violence against his brother and though he tries to apologize Ponyboy bolts from the house He returns to the vacant lot wakes Johnny up and tells him that they are running away
