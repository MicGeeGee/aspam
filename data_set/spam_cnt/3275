service! I went 19507446re with a party of 6, got seated and serviced ra19507446r fast.  19507446 food was good. I love 19507446 way that all 19507446 ladies tend to all 19507446 tables! So 19507446n you dont have to wait for your assigned person to fill your drink, chips, or salsa. All in all, I really like a good place with decent prices, good salsa (pretty darn hot salsa). Service is great. I cannot say that enough. Go here if you want good drinks, great service, good food & it looked like people were enjoying 19507446ir tequila shots, go here! Talk about a  good spot. Intimate lighting but still great for groups because it was ra19507446r loud. When we got here, it was packed. We were right after a group of six. 19507446 wait wasn't that bad. I think about 15 minutes or so. 19507446 top shelf margarita was excellent. You really get that kick and taste that it's not made from a mixer like o19507446r places. 19507446 mixture was perfect.  While we waited, we were served chips and salsa like most place, but 19507446 salsa here was ra19507446r spicy. I LOVED IT. It didn't taste like it was just mashed up tomatoes and some herbs. It tasted like how real salsa should taste! I ordered 19507446 Chile Colorado. It came with 19507446 soup of 19507446 day ( meatball soup for today) or a salad. I opted for 19507446 soup. No disappointment 19507446re. It had an interesting flavor that I enjoyed. Mildly sweet, but still very savory.  just for kicks, i scooped in some salsa and it just added on to 19507446 already great flavor. If 19507446 appetizer was already this good, how much better can it get Much better. 19507446 Chile Colorado was cook perfectly. It came with a side of beans and rice but 19507446 meat was delicious. 19507446 sauce had blended well with 19507446 meat. 19507446 only thing was, while understandable because it was pretty packed, it took pretty long for 19507446 server to get to us to take our order. I definitely will try this place again when it's a little less packed. If you have 19507446 time, go here. True, 19507446 service is inconsistent, but 19507446 food is 19507446 best, hands down. 19507446 rice and beans are cooked perfectly every time, 19507446 salsa is always a little spicy, and 19507446 Chile Verde is always tender (with a kick!).  4) "19507446 service". 19507446 place is a hole-in-19507446-wall. 19507446 food is never late, so yes, 19507446 service is moderate to weak. I've been to a lot of places in Chicago, New York, and yes, our beloved San Francisco, where 19507446 food is fantastic and 19507446 service is meh. Eat enough food and realize that with a $10-$14 plate tag, 19507446 service may suffer, or else 19507446 food will. It's not acceptable, but 19507446 food is worth much more than 19507446 tag, especially with places like Zocalo, Ernesto's, and Mas around. O19507446rwise, Tres Hermanas has about 19507446 best chips and salsa I've had in quite a while and I owe it all to attending a birthday menage-a-trois when I was visiting my dear friends in Sacramento. First off, 19507446 place was packed.  Something I was not expecting but once inside, I could see why.
