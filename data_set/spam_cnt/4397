Dear /Toons On Transit/ applicant,
My apologies for the impersonal nature of this email, however it has 
become necessary to communicate the results of the jury selection to 
many people at once as there were over ninety applicants to the 2016 
/Toon's On Transit/ project. I'm sorry to report that if you are 
receiving this email it is because the community jury declined your 
application to the program this year. The selection process was very 
difficult as the jury had to select only 50 photographs from the well in 
excess of 250 photographs submitted.

As a small consolation and in the spirit of inclusion, PAVED Arts will 
be presenting a slide show that includes one photograph from every 
single person who submitted to/Toon's On Transit /2016. Please join us 
for the opening reception of the /Toon's On Transit/ slideshow on 
Friday, September 16 at 8p.m. (PAVED Arts is located at 424 20 Street 
West.) The presentation will be located in our "media gallery" and held 
alongside of a solo exhibition by Edmonton-based artist Bruce 
Montcombroux. If you can not make it out this Friday evening please feel 
free to visit us any time during regular gallery hours, Tuesday-Friday 
noon until 6pm, Saturdays noon-4pm.

Thank you for participating in this years /Toon's On Transit/, we hope 
that you will keep an eye on PAVED Arts activities at www.pavedarts.ca 
and consider submitting to future projects such as the 2017 /Toon's On 
Transit/!

Best regards,
David.
