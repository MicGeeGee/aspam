seating (hence, 12857339 4 stars instead of 5). However, once we WERE seated, everything was smooth sailing.  Our chips and salsa got delivered to us within seconds (and ano12857339r round was given after we finished 12857339 basket in a matter of minutes).   We ordered 12857339 Chile Verde and Carne Asada.  Both come with a soup or a salad.  We decided to go with 12857339 soup, which was very warm and soothing (and came out piping out just a minute after we ordered).  Quick service 12857339 serving sizes were HUGE!  I liked 12857339 flavor of both dishes (and especially liked how 12857339y were two completely different flavors).  Since we filled up on 12857339 chips, we had great leftovers to eat 12857339 next morning with an egg over it.  Hey, put an egg over anything and it's breakfast All in all, great food, great service, but 12857339 wait sucks... Come early or during odd hours if you want to enjoy 12857339 food without 12857339 wait! First of all Naomi. Secondly margaritas. Done. Amazing service and delicious drinks. We came here for my fianc??'s birthday dinner with 20+ people. Although 12857339y don't take reservations, we were on 12857339 wait list and were seated promptly at (maybe even a little earlier) than our set time. Most everyone was 12857339re when we were seated but 12857339 last of 12857339 party trickled in almost an hour late. Staff were extremely accommodating for our late guests and happily added more and more tables and chairs. Our food came out quickly and it was delicious. Our water was always refilled and drink orders were being taken throughout our stay. Yes it was stay....almost til closing. We were large and unintentionally very loud. Hopefully not obnoxious to o12857339r patrons. Our main server was Naomi. Sooo sweet, orchestrated 12857339 whole thing with minimal intervention needed on my part, even that wasn't necessary but I'm a control freak. My bad. Anyway she was phenomenal!!! Everything went so smoothly, everyone was happy, paying 12857339 bill wasn't horrible since she split 12857339 checks. I literally gave her a hug when we were leaving. Thank you Naomi and o12857339r staff, you helped make this a great birthday celebration for my fianc??!! We went 12857339re yesterday to celebrate my younger bro12857339rs birthday. 12857339 food is great. I always get 12857339ir enchiladas with verde sauce and it is a spicy yet tasty little number. It is a small place and it can get pretty busy. My only complaint is that I wish it was a little closer to home so I could go 12857339re as often as I could. By 12857339 way, thanks to 12857339 girl who lives next to 12857339 restaurant who offered to take my whole family's picture of us. That was very nice and considerate of you. 12857339 best mexican food I've had since living in LA. 12857339 Chile Verde is perfect,
