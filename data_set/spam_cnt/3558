Simple 2 Minute Exercise For A Younger Brain
===================================

Brain Function News for bruce@untroubled.org,

Have you ever thought about what it would be like to have a crystal clear
focus 24 hours a day from the moment you get up, till the minute you go to bed?

No more forgetting things ...

No more embarrassing "senior moments" ...

And no more "brain fog" that clouds your judgment and creates confusion.

Just a clear head with "rapid fire" thoughts and memory recollection as fast as flicking on a light switch.

Well, thanks to the remarkable work of a 103 year old veteran, the dream has become a reality for over 39,144 people worldwide.

And yes... He's over 100... but you wouldn't know it by talking to him.  He is as sharp, witty and fun loving as a man in his twenties.
