After a few weeks of being on the road all Josh could think of was food Before his mind was taken over by a myriad of thoughts However he just wants to eat a satisfying meal Josh had resorted to scavenging for food inside garbage cans Joey would eat everything his brother found with gusto but Josh felt sick whenever he watched his young brother eat He didnt want to do it but he had to or else they would starve The only thing he was proud of was that he never let Joey join him whenever he searched for food However he was ashamed of himself for not resorting to begging That was something that he let Joey do Joey never complained about this because he knew that people would rather share with little boys rather than someone of Joshs age He realized that hes letting Joey face the humility of begging because he couldnt He did his share of begging as well but he never really got accustomed to it One night he dropped by a house and was given a cardboard box full of food by a pretty girl Josh couldnt look into her eyes and say thank you He was too ashamed with what he was doing  -->

Of course there were times when he and Joey would feel that its time to give up However something always happened that makes them want to continue on One night they ended up at a farmhouse in Nebraska where an old lady welcomed them inside and fed them supper The lady let them take a bath and stay the night She washed their clothes and fed them breakfast the next morning She asked them questions about their parents and proceeded to ask Josh to write home to his mama Josh refused and suggested that Joey can write to them if he wanted to The old lady said that it was better to write home because their mother could sleep better at night knog that her boys are still alive When they left they were full of regret They wanted to stay with the old lady but they had to get going They were in a bit of luck ad they had found a truck driver that let them ride with him Joey slept through the whole ride while Josh spoke to the driver about why they ran away They continued on the road and had a bite to eat by dusk Josh tried to refuse saying that he didnt have any  and that the old lady gave them a hearty breakfast The driver told him to not worry about it because theyre just having some soup and hamburgers The waitress called the driver Lonnie proving that they knew that truck driver While waiting for their food at the caf they told Lonnie about Howie and the other things that they encountered since they went on the road Lonnie asked Bessie the waitress if Josh could play the piano inside the caf She let them use it while they were waiting for the burgers to cook They all watched Josh play the piano and were astounded with the music While they were eating Bessie handed Lonnie a piece of paper with a name and an address It was written with the information of a Pete Harris the waitress cousin He ran a carnival in Baton Rouge and sometimes hired piano players That night they slept at the back of the truck Before Josh would stay awake because of the cold and his hunger Now he stayed awake because he felt excited After a long while he heard Lonnie speak up and told him why his son died

The first day when they encountered warm weather they ate their meal on the grass under a clump of trees While Joey and Lonnie were singing together Josh fell asleep He awoke to the two speaking about him He heard about how fondly Joey spoke about their father Josh was certain about one thing He would never extend a helping hand to his father once he gets a job It wasnt long until theyve reached Louisiana One evening they finally found the carnival that Bessie talked about After roaming around the carnival they found Pete Harris Lonnie spoke with him and Pete confirmed that Bessie is indeed his cousin Pet admitted that his carnival might not last long with people refusing to let go of their  like they used to Lonnie sympathized and told Pete that it wouldnt hurt if he heard Josh play He played enthusiastically thinking  that Pete should give him a chance with the way he plays
