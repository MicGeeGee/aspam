  Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all things in their places Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that was never to leave off From the Palace of the Tuileriesthrough Monseigneur and the whole Courtthrough the Chambersthe Tribunals of Justiceand all society except the scarecrowsthe Fancy Ball descended to the Common Executioner whoin pursuance of the charmwas required to officiate frizzledpowderedin a goldlaced coatpumpsand white silk stockings At the gallows and the wheelthe axe was a rarityMonsieur Parisas it was the episcopal mode among his brother Professors of the provincesMonsieur Orleansand the restto call himpresided in this dainty dress And who among the company at Monseigneurs reception in that seventeen  and eightieth year of our Lordcould possibly doubtthat a system rooted in a frizzled hangmanpowderedgoldlacedpumpedand whitesilk stockingedwould see the very stars out

 breedingwhich was at that remarkable timeand has been sinceto be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject of human interestwere in the most exemplary state of exhaustionat the hotel of Monseigneur Such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paristhat the spies among the assembled devotees of Monseigneurforming a goodly half of the polite companywould have found it  to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wifewhoin her manners and appearanceowned to being a Mother Indeedexcept for the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this worldwhich does not go far towards the realisation of the name of motherthere was no such thing known to the fashion Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies closeand brought them upand charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty

  The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon Monseigneur In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional people who had hadfor a few yearssome vague misgiving in them that things in general were going rather wrong As a promising way of setting them righthalf of the halfdozen had become members of a fantastic sect of Convulsionistsand were even then considering within themselves whether they should foamrageroarand turn cataleptic on the spotthereby setting up a highly intelligible fingerpost to the Futurefor Monseigneurs guidance Besides these Dervisheswere other three who had rushed into another sectwhich mended matters with a jargon about the Centre of Truth holding that Man had got out of the Centre of Truthwhich did not need much demonstrationbut had not got out of the Circumferenceand that he was to be kept from flying out of the Circumferenceand was even to be shoved back into the Centreby fasting and seeing of spirits Among theseaccordinglymuch discoursing with spirits went onand it did a world of good which never became manifest
