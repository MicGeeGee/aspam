<P>The entrance of the Judgeand a consequent great stir and settling down in the courtstopped the dialogue Presentlythe dock became the central point of interest Two gaolerswho had been standing therewent outand the prisoner was brought inand put to the bar

  Everybody presentexcept the one wigged gentleman who looked at the ceilingstared at him All the human breath in the placerolled at himlike a seaor a dor a fire Eager faces strained round pillars and cornersto get a sight of him spectators in back rows stood upnot to miss a hair of him people on the floor of the courtlaid their hands on the shoulders of the people before themto help themselvesat anybodys costto a view of himstood atiptoegot upon ledgesstood upon next to nothingto see every inch of him Conspicuous among these latterlike an animated bit of the spiked wall of NewgateJerry stood aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a whet he had taken as he came alongand discharging it to mingle with the waves of other beerand ginand teaand coffeeand what notthat flowed at himand already broke upon the great dows behind him in an impure mist and rain

  The object of all this staring and blaringwas a young man of about fiveandtwentywellgrown and welllookingwith a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye His condition was that of a young gentleman He was plainly dressed in blackor very dark greyand his hairwhich was long and darkwas gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck more to be out of his way than for ornament As an emotion of the mind will express itself through any covering of the bodyso the paleness which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheekshog the soul to be stronger than the sun He was otherwise quite selfpossessedbowed to the Judgeand stood quiet

  The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed atwas not a sort that elevated humanity Had he stood in peril of a less horrible sentencehad there been a chance of any one of its savage details being sparedby just so much would he have lost in his fascination The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangledwas the sight the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and torn asunderyielded the sensation Whatever gloss the various spectators put upon the interestaccording to their several arts and powers of selfdeceitthe interest wasat the root of itOgreish
