Doctor Reveals "Herpes Can Be Cured"
Study No. 17654942
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Herpes Sufferer bruce@untroubled.org,

I've had a severe herpes infection for seven years.

I've tried all the herpes therapies you can think of, including all the herbs, Valtrex, even the ridiculously expensive ozone.

What has brought me the most relief -- and I mean no more symptoms -- and not a trace of the virus in my body -- is this treatment.

It has also taken care of the neuralgia associated with the infection and sickening side effects of medications.

Best of all, it's so simple and inexpensive.  It costs only a fraction of acyclovir.

To a Herpes-Free Life,

Marcus W.
(former herpes sufferer)

P.S. Being herpes-free has changed my life!
