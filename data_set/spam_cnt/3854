 an of material peril will be wanting at the critical moment Would this fervor of the  States hold out Was it kindled by a just feeling of the value of constitutional liberty Had it body enough to withstand the inevitable dampening of checks reverses delays Had our population intelligence enough to comprehend that the choice was between order and anarchy between the equilibrium of a government by law and the tussle of misrule by pronunciamiento Could a war be maintained without the ordinary stimulus of hatred and plunder and with the impersonal loyalty of principle These were serious questions and with no precedent to aid in answering them

At the beginning of the war there was indeed occasion for the most anxious apprehension A President known to be infected with the political heresies and suspected of sympathy with the treason of the Southern conspirators had just surrendered the reins we will not say of power but of chaos to a successor known only as the representative of a party whose leaders with long training in opposition had none in the conduct of affairs an empty treasury was called on to supply resources beyond precedent in the history of finance the trees were

And even if we look only at more palpable difficulties the problem to be solved by our civil war was so vast both in its immediate relations and its future consequences the conditions of its solution were so intricate and so greatly dependent on incalculable and uncontrollable contingencies so many of the data whether for hope or fear were from their novelty incapable of arrangement under any of the categories of historical precedent that there were moments of crisis when the firmest believer in the strength and sufficiency of the democratic theory of government might well hold his breath in vague apprehension of disaster Our teachers of political philosophy solemnly arguing from the precedent of some petty Grecian Italian or Flemish city whose long periods of aristocracy were broken now and then by awkward parentheses of mob had always taught us that democracies were incapable of the sentiment of loyalty of concentrated and prolonged effort of farreaching conceptions were absorbed in material interests impatient of regular and much more of exceptional
