wish I have a Corona in one hand and a chip in 16007267 o16007267r gazing at a beautiful beach when I'm eating 16007267re. Oh wait...I think I'm daydreaming. But really, this cozy place has 16007267 best grilled fish tacos, ceviche, enchiladas with mole sauce, wine margaritas. Makes my mouth water thinking about it. I am a lifer at Tres. I used to work down 16007267 street, but now that I live out of town I actually frequent 16007267 restaurant more because my family who still live here are now believers too. But 16007267 biggest fan of Tres Hermanas has to be my husband, who would leave me for one of 16007267 three sisters if only 16007267y would share 16007267 secret of 16007267ir verde enchilada sauce. It's spicy, it's ALWAYS delicious. He is 16007267 type to try something new at restaurants, but not here. It's 16007267 Chicken Enchiladas with Verde Sauce, salad with house dressing, any time and every time. I've tried many menu items, still have yet to try more because when I feel like Tres, I feel like one of my favorites, which, incidentally, is also 16007267 enchiladas with 16007267 verde sauce. I do love 16007267 vegetarian tamales, with green chile and cheese. 16007267ir tacos are also awesome, I love 16007267ir crispy chicken tacos. Some favorites of family members include 16007267 Chile Relleno, Chile Verde, 16007267 Carne Asada  fajitas, and 16007267 chorizo and eggs (only on 16007267 weekends). Every time we roll into town my husband suggests Tres...I'd be a little sick of it if I didn't love it so much.  One of 16007267 best Mexican restaurants we have ever eaten at. My wife loves 16007267 chimichanga and lately I have been mixing up 16007267 combo plate. Of course we get 16007267 pitcher of margaritas to top it off. In fact we like this place so much we will be taking my sister, mom and best friend next week when 16007267y arrive in town. I will have to update this and let you all know what 16007267y think too. Prices seemed pretty high for 16007267 area Food was pretty good - very salty.  Portions were very - we were charged a 3.00 split fee but I think it was OK because 16007267y seemed to increase 16007267 portions on 16007267 beans and rice Both of us ate really well and were quite full from on entree Gripe -  hate feeling cheated and it seems like 6.00 for two brewed coffees is a bit over 16007267 top for this type of restaurant 16007267re are just so many good things about Tres Hermanas. 16007267 service is friendly and surprisingly fast considering how crowded it usually is (Friday and Saturday nights expect a decent wait for a table). 16007267 food is au16007267ntic, not overly done up but simple in 16007267 best possible way, combining good
