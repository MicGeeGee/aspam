For most American adults, bathing has long been more than a cleansing process. We tend to linger and luxuriate in our tubs as the warm waters soak into our bodies and our souls - or we tend to come awake and feel more alive as cool waters swirl around and refresh, getting us going when we need a little stimulation.

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Seniors tend to worry - We can relieve those fears!</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">For many of us, a leisurely bath has been one of life's simple pleasures we've always taken for granted... until the day when a tub bath became no longer a simple matter. That's the day we briefly lost our balance getting into the tub, or the day we felt our feet slip on the wet surface getting out. Perhaps we heard for the first time the statistic that one in three Americans over age 65 suffers a fall at some point each year, or perhaps we learned of a neighbor or friend who had fallen in their bathroom and broken a wrist or a hip.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Seniors have enough to worry about - physical changes, health, finances, loss of independence, medications, issues of life and death - and they definitely don't need to be worried about something as basic as a nice, warm bath.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Open the door to blissful relaxation</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">We never get too old to enjoy the luxury of a nice, warm bath. In fact, the older we get, the more our bodies can benefit from the soothing waters that can ease and wash away the stress and anxieties that often come with the years.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Open the door to pain management and other unexpected health benefits</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">We've all had the experience of reducing our minor aches and pains with a soothing bath, but now researchers are finding more and more health benefits to hydrotherapy.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Hydrotherapy can boost circulation to your limbs, helping tissues and muscles to heal faster. It promotes the flow of endorphins, and a warm bath can lead to a good night's sleep.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">And, as was pointed out above, it can help relieve the stress that plays a role in many other health concerns. Hydrotherapy is not a cure-all... but it can help reduce the pain and discomfort of many common conditions that come with aging.</p>
