Our first priority after that was making sure every resident knew not to dig not to be in contact with the soil Mr Kaplan said Since early June he said the EPA has been covering bare soil around the complex with mulch; going door to door with fliers; and posting yard signs that warn Do not play in the dirt or around the mulch The EPA has also been testing for lead inside homes and offering to deepclean them as a temporary measure

Mr Kaplan said the EPA had in fact warned West Calumet residents to avoid the soil for at least a decade with public notices and community meetings Mr Kaplan said the hot spots discovered during preliminary testing had not created a sense of urgency partly because a 2011 federal assessment of the Superfund site concluded that breathing the air drinking tap water or playing in soil in the area is not expected to harm peoples health

When the EPA gave the lead and arsenic data to city officials on May 24 Mr Copeland decided to seek to demolish the housing complex instead of moving ahead with the EPAs soil removal plan

I cannot multiply this enough times to tell you the irreparable damage that can happen to your child Mr Copeland told residents of the complex at a meeting on Aug 3 I do not see how you can remove tons and tons of dirt and dont aggravate the problem

Mr Kaplan said the EPA still believed that removing the contaminated soil was safe But he added we respect the mayor saying he wants to go a different way

Mr Copelands office referred questions to Carla Morgan the city attorney who reiterated that Mr Copeland had sought to relocate West Calumet residents as soon as he learned the specific lead and arsenic levels in their soil

Last week at the complex which was built in 1972 some older residents said they resented being forced out while many younger ones said they could not wait to move Some including Ms King were already packing

The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development has provided the East Chicago Housing Authority with 19 million to help residents pay for new rentals in the city or anywhere in the country starting next month But many questions remain including whether the city state or federal government will cover residents moving expenses and security deposits and whether they will be able to find safe affordable housing with the amounts they receive So far only100000 has been allocated by the state for moving expenses
