  Yes It took four menall four ablaze with gorgeous decorationand the Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocketemulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneurto conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneurs lips One lacquey carried the chocolatepot into the sacred presence a secondmilled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function a thirdpresented the favoured napkin a fourth he of the two gold watchespoured the chocolate out It was impossible for Monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring Heavens Deep would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men he must have died of two

  Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last nightwhere the Comedy and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented Monseigneur was out at a little supper most nightswith fascinating company So polite and so impressible was Monseigneurthat the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and state secretsthan the needs of all France A happy circumstance for Franceas the like always is for all countries similarly favouredalways was for England by way of examplein the regretted days of the merry Stuart who sold it

  Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public businesswhich wasto let everything go on in its own way of particular public businessMonseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his waytend to his own power and pocket Of his pleasuresgeneral and particularMonseigneur had the other truly noble ideathat the world was made for them The text of his order altered from the original by only a pronounwhich is not much ran The earth and the fulness thereof are minesaith Monseigneur

  YetMonseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into his affairsboth private and public and he hadas to both classes of affairsallied himself perforce with a FarmerGeneral As to finances publicbecause Monseigneur could not make anything at all of themand must consequently let them out to somebody who could as to finances privatebecause FarmerGenerals were richand Monseigneurafter generations of great luxury and expensewas grog poor Hence Monseigneur had taken his sister from a conventwhile there was yet time to ward off the impending veilthe cheapest garment she could wearand had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich FarmerGeneralpoor in family Which FarmerGeneralcarrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of itwas now among the company in the outer roomsmuch prostrated before by mankindalways excepting superior mankind of the blood of Monseigneurwhohis own wife includedlooked down upon him with the loftiest contempt
