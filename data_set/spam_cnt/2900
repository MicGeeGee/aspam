Scientific Breakthrough - "Miracle" Enzyme Reverses Baldness 
==========================================

New Update Regarding Hair Loss for:
 bruce@untroubled.org,

If you are experience thinning or hair loss, this is for you.

Just 2 months ago David McKenna was too embarrassed to leave his home without a cap on...

He was rejected by the woman he approached...

His shiny bald head made him feel unattractive. 

But then something changed.

Through the help of an non-traditional doctor, David discovered a remarkable, but powerful tip to reverse his baldness, and shockingly about 3 months later, he had a full head of hair. Now David is the one rejecting the women.

It was all thanks to the discovery of an 'odd' enzyme.  Best of all, anyone, male or female, can utilize the power of this enzyme to regrow beautiful, thick, healthy hair.
