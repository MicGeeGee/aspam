		(sometimes) wait you encounter on a busy night.  But that's to be expected at a quality restaurant, especially one right on K Street.  Once you're seated though, 6228343 service is great. I've been a bunch of times and will be back a bunch of times. My latest order was a carnitas burrito plate and it was good! So were 6228343 beans and rice.  Muy bueno. 4 stars. We've been to Tres Hermanas a few times and really love 6228343 food - 6228343 carnitas is excellent and 6228343 chili relleno is mouth watering!  It is a bit on 6228343 pricey side, but 6228343 food is well worth it.  Staff is nice, not overly friendly, but not rude.  We usually go with our kids, and like 6228343 low key atmosphere  =)  Portions are big, not a fan of 6228343 split plate charge though.  Overall, we'll be back  =) If Tres Hermanas offered 6228343ir house dressing as a cold soup item (and 6228343y really should, albeit garnished with a few festive pomegranate seeds) I'd order a bowl of it. From my first lunch on 6228343 patio here, in 1998, I've most associated this restaurant with that dressing -- a very fresh tasting blend of cilantro and (I'm guessing) buttermilk, and have sampled several cilantro-based dressings over 6228343 years, including a bottled one in 6228343 refrigerated case at Trader Joes, in my quest to find a locally obtainable substitute, but all of 6228343m have paled in comparison. 6228343 plated vegetarian dinners don't particularly shine and offer few surprises in 6228343ir composition in 6228343 way that, say, Oakland's Dona Tomas or Cafe Campesino in Santa Cruz do, but 6228343 food is solid and 6228343 kitchen obliged (as it always does) my friend's request for 6228343 grilled achiote vegetable dish, without 6228343 cheese. And 6228343 interior, despite that several waiting parties of diners hovered at 6228343 room's center, was comfortable and lacked 6228343 din that can make shared conversation a challenge in so many modern, cavernous restaurants. Tres Hermanas is a great midtown restaurant choice if you're out on a winter stroll and looking to trade in 6228343 cold air for a warm, convivial spot. Now, back to that dressing. 6228343 hostess had mistakenly sat us after about an eight minute wait, and we rose from 6228343 booth with a tinge of disappointment and ga6228343red 'round 6228343 Christmas tree again (conversing ra6228343r than caroling). After several minutes more we were reseated at a better location at 6228343 front window, next to one of my former Spanish language instructors at CSUS (like 16 years ago former), which did not deter me, once I'd cleared 6228343 salad greens off my plate, from lifting said plate to my mouth and quickly tossing back 6228343 small reservoir of dressing. Although, for 6228343 record, my former instructor IS sight impaired which may have been 6228343 green light I needed.
