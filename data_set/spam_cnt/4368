Everyone... 3.5 stars....If you're looking for a restaurant before heading to Jiffy Lube Live, this would be a decent choice for a sit-down restaurant that isn't a chain.... This place is a amazing! I can't believe that the place didn't have more people. Get to this place now before it takes off and gets harder to get a table.... I'm a fan of Thai food and the food here is decent. For appetizers I chose duck rolls and shrimps in a blanket. They were both flavorful and the shrimps in... Fantastically friendly owner and staff. The upstairs deck makes for a relaxing time...  Food was Awesome. Hush puppies  Crab stuffed mushrooms. Cedar plank... Amazing food! Low prices, it's a community Hispanic place food group to come to. Friendly staff and always remember your previous orders! Gf8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
