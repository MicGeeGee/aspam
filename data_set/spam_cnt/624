    But I would hold a pretty wagersirthat a House like Tellson and Company was flourishinga matter of fiftynot to speak of fifteen years ago

  You might treble thatand say a  and fiftyyet not be far from the truth

  Indeedsir

   Are you quite a stranger to mesir

  As I was saying if Monsieur Manette had not died if he had suddenly and silently disappeared if he had been spirited away if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful placethough no art could trace him if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisperacross the water there for instancethe privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time if his wife had implored the kingthe queenthe courtthe clergyfor any tidings of himand all quite in vainthen the history of your father would have been the history of this unfortunate gentlemanthe Doctor of Beauvais

  I will I am going to You can bear it

  I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment

  Perfectly still and silentand not even fallen back in her chairshe sat under his handutterly insensible with her eyes open and fixed upon himand with that last expression looking as if it were carved or branded into her forehead So close was her hold upon his armthat he feared to detach himself lest he
