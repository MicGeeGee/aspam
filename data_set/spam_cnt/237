Looked for a local place heading back to KY to get out of the rain.  Thanks to yelp i found this gem.  On site micro brewery real good pale ale thriller.... Everything was great!!! The service was excellent and the staff was very friendly!....The food was fantastic! The best ribs I've had in a while, and the... Been to this place and other similar Pizza Kings for many years, but haven't tried it for at least ten years. So I grabbed Junior and hit the road to... Awesome Chicken!. Stopped here on the way home from Cincy as it had been on my wishlist for a while. I am sure glad we did!....For starters, the town of... Some amazing food for fabulous prices.They have a unique Italian dressing that is very good! Good service, nice atmosphere. With hubby driving to Waco, I myself looking at the phone, just happened to glance up and there she was COCOAMODA!  I didn't even think we would be passing... This is so much better than any other restaurant in Waco it's like it's on another planet. Small, simple menu for breakfast and lunch. Nothing sounds fancy... Great evening for drinks and dinner. We had Krystal\"s Splash and a Margarita Montelongo. Ian was our bartender and was great. ....We had the Stuffed Avocado,... This place was packed on Friday night! My spaghetti with pink sauce and side of veggies was absolutely delicious. My husband's pizza with veggies was really... Great food and great service! I'll definitely be back to try the fish! I'd take a picture of what I got but I already ate it! Great stop between Houston and Dallas!....This restaurant has a welcoming, small town feeling, where everyone knows everyone and it is so... Probably the best Italian you are going to find in Buffalo, TX. Wait staff and the owner were very polite and helpful. Hands down, the BEST cajun restaurant in Waco and possibly the state. The most authentic Cajun food I've had outside of New Orleans.....Po-boys are jam packed...f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
