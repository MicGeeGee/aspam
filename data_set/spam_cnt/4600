<p>Scientific Breakthrough - "Miracle" Enzyme Reverses Baldness <br />
***********************************************</p>
<p>New Update Regarding Hair Loss for:<br />
bruce@untroubled.org,</p>
<p>If you are experience thinning or hair loss, this is for you.</p>
<p>Just 2 months ago David McKenna was too self-conscious to leave his home without a hat on...</p>
<p>He was shunned by every woman he approached...</p>
<p>His shiny bald head made him feel self-conscious. </p>
<p>But then something changed.</p>
<p>Through the help of an non-traditional doctor, David discovered an unusual, but powerful tip to reverse his baldness, and surprisingly less than 3 months later, he had a full head of hair. Now David is the one rejecting the women.</p>
<p>It was all thanks to the discovery of an 'odd' enzyme. Best of all, anyone, male or female, can use this enzyme to regrow beautiful, thick, healthy hair.</p>
