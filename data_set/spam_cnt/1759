Scientific Breakthrough - "Miracle" Enzyme Reverses Baldness 
==========================================

Important Update Regarding Hair Loss for:
 bruce@untroubled.org,

If you are experience thinning or hair loss, this is for you.

Just 2 months ago David McKenna was too embarrassed to leave his home without a hat on...

He was rejected by the woman he approached...

His shiny bald head made him feel unattractive. 

But then something changed.

Through the help of an non-traditional doctor, David discovered an unusual, but powerful tip to reverse his hair loss, and surprisingly less than 3 months later, he had a full head of hair. Now David is the one rejecting the women.

It was all thanks to the discovery of an 'odd' enzyme.  Best of all, anyone, men or women, can use this enzyme to regrow gorgeous, full, healthy hair.
