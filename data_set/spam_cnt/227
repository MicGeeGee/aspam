Plex DVR recording is finally here thanks to a new partnership with the SiliconDust, the makers of the HDHomeRun digital tuner. Plex DVR enables free over-the-air access to 86 of Nielsenâ€™s 100 most watched shows in the US for 2016, according to Plex. One show that it wont work with is Game of Thrones because thats only visible on encrypted HBO channels. Plex says that Broadcast TV delivered via antenna is available immediately â€” no waiting an extra day (or months) to watch, as is the case with many streaming services, with a wink and a nod directed at Hulu. And while that sounds like time-shifted, or even live streaming of broadcast television shows, Plex says that currently only shows recorded to completion can be viewed with Plex DVR. Still, you can keep adding tuners and storage to record as many shows at a time as you like.

Once recorded, Plex DVR users can view their shows from pretty much any device, online or off, from anywhere in the world thanks to a multitude of clients for iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac devices; Roku, Chromecast, Amazon Fire, Apple TV, and other media streamers; Xbox and PlayStation game consoles; and many brands of smart TVs.
