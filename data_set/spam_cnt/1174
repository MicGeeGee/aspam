The ribs are fall of the bone tender and absolutely delicious!!!  The service is very friendly as well.  The brisket... I stopped in for lunch and everything was great! Especially the dinner salad, which was fresh cut lettuce with toppings. I just wish the dressing was... i've been here on regular night but never on a sunday when it's chef's choice. ..last night i brought my family from out of town who left so happy and full...

My folks were in town and we wanted to treat them to a special \"welcome to Seattle\" night by trying out Copine.  To say that the experience was... This was my first time here.  The place has a cool vibe and the music was great.  I got my order to go so I didn't get a chance to eat there.  ....I ordered... Great place! Good food, and close to what I would call a perfect menu; there is NOTHING on this menu I would not order AND enjoy. That is super... Best cauliflower I have ever had.
