  You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witnessMiss Manette She will do very well You have seen the worst of her agitation

  I am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it Could you tell her so for mewith my fervent acknowledgments
<img src="http://chate.notgonememory.com/redirect.php?email=bruce@untroubled.org">
  YesI could I willif you ask it

  Mr Cartons manner was so careless as to be almost insolent He stoodhalf turned from the prisonerlounging with his elbow against the bar

  I do ask it Accept my cordial thanks

  Whatsaid Cartonstill only half turned towards himdo you expectMr Darnay

  The worst
<br>
<br>

 Yessir

  Hastily written on the paper was the word Acquitted

  If you had sent the messageRecalled to Lifeagainmuttered Jerryas he turnedI should have known what you meantthis time

  He had no opportunity of sayingor so much as thinkinganything elseuntil he was clear of the Old Bailey forthe crowd came pouring out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legsand a loud buzz swept into the street as if the baffled blueflies were dispersing in search of other carrion

IV Congratulatory

t clearly being incumbent on some one to sayMuch betterMr Lorry said it perhaps not quite disinterestedlybut with the interested object of squeezing himself back again
<br>
<br>

  You think so said Mr Stryver Well you have been present all dayand you ought to know You are a man of businesstoo

  And as suchquoth Mr Lorrywhom the counsel learned in the law had now shouldered back into the groupjust as he had previously shouldered him out of itas such I will appeal to Doctor Manetteto break up this conference and order us all to our homes Miss Lucie looks illMr Darnay has had a terrible daywe are worn out
