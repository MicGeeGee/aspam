<P style="color:#B1B1B1; font-size:9px; text-align:justify">  The bill being paidCharles Darnay rose and wished him good night Without returning the wishCarton rose toowith something of a threat of defiance in his mannerand saidA last wordMr Darnay you think I am drunk

V The Jackal

  Whats the matter

  Ten oclocksir

  What do you mean Ten oclock at night

  Yessir Your honour told me to call you

  Oh I remember Very wellvery well

  After a few dull efforts to get to sleep againwhich the man dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minuteshe got uptossed his hat onand walked out He turned into the Templeandhaving revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of Kings Benchwalk and Paperbuildingsturned into the Stryver chambers
<img src="http://cenure.oldwindowsaway.com/redirect.php?email=bruce@untroubled.org">
  The Stryver clerkwho never assisted at these conferenceshad gone homeand the Stryver principal opened the door He had his slippers onand a loose bedgownand his throat was bare for his greater ease He had that rather wildstrainedseared marking about the eyeswhich may be observed in all  livers of his classfrom the portrait of Jeffries downwardand which can be tracedunder various disguises of Artthrough the portraits of every Drinking Age

  You are a little lateMemorysaid Stryver

  About the usual time it may be a quarter of an hour later

  They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with paperswhere there was a blazing fire A kettle steamed upon the hoband in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shonewith plenty of e upon itand brandyand rumand sugarand lemons

  You have had your bottleI perceiveSydney

  Two tonightI think I have been dining with the days client or seeing him dineits all one

  That was a rare pointSydneythat you brought to bear upon the identification How did you come by it When did it strike you

  I thought he was rather a handsome fellowand I thought I should have been much the same sort of fellowif I had had any luck

  Mr Stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch

  You and your luckSydney Get to workget to work

  Sullenly enoughthe jackal loosened his dresswent into an adjoining roomand came back with a large jug of cold watera basinand a towel or two Steeping the towels in the waterand partially wringing them outhe folded them on his head in a manner hideous to beholdsat down at the tableand saidNow I am ready

  Not much boiling down to be done tonightMemorysaid Mr Stryvergailyas he looked among his papers
