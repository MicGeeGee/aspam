		this sounds weird because red sauce at Mexican restaurants is usually not 14569661 star of 14569661 dish, but for some reason 14569661irs is outstanding!  Usually I am a big fan of salsa verde.  On my first trip here, 14569661 waitress warned me that it was really hot.  I should have believed her--only those with tongues of steel should venture into that dish.  Although it still tasted really good, even though it was super hot. Best Mexican food in Sacramento - obviously 14569661re is better Mexican food in o14569661r places, especially closer to Mexico - that is a totally moronic discussion to have. 14569661 enchiladas are incredible.  Note, I grew up in Sou14569661rn California and consider myself a tough judge of Mexican food. I highly recommend 14569661 carnitas enchiladas with 14569661 mole sauce which is actually 14569661 best plated Mexican dish I have found anywhere in California. 14569661 mole is superb - flavorful but not too sweet.  It is served with a salad and you must request 14569661 cilantro dressing which is incredible - this makes a great pairing with 14569661 chips and salsa which stand up to anything you will find anywhere else. 14569661 bar is excellent.  Jared, 14569661 regular bartender is a great guy and makes stiff but very tasty drinks - a real mixologist. 14569661 overall atmosphere is great and 14569661 staff are obviously a close knit team that love to work at Tres Hermanas.   My boyfriend and I have been going here for years and it is one of our favorite (his absolute favorite) place to get mexican food in Sacramento. A lot of 14569661se reviews complain of service, and to be honest, I have never had a poor experience with 14569661 service. I have always been served within a timely manner and only occasionally had to try to get 14569661 attention of a waitress for a refill on a busy night. 14569661 food always comes out quickly, and it is always good! Strong margaritas, really great salsa. 14569661re are plenty of great Mexican food places in downtown Sacramento but I am really stuck on 14569661 top 2! Ernesto's is 14569661 place for 14569661 most amazing margaritas and Centro's is 14569661 place for amazing food, especially 14569661 guacamole! Tres Hermanas definitely has it's place in 14569661re though! It is my second pick in Sacramento for best Sangria right after 14569661 tower cafe! Service is decent and 14569661 area is easy enough to get to! all in all it's not 14569661 best but it is by no means 14569661 worst. Tres is a decent experience and definitely one I would recommend making your own judgment on. This is hands-down my favorite Mexican restaurant in both Sacramento and Davis. 14569661 food is delicious. 14569661 salsa and cilantro salad dressing are amazing. I've had 14569661 tamales, chilaquiles, and 14569661 norte??o salad at 14569661 Davis location (not sure if 14569661y're also at 14569661 Sac one) and all three were fantastic. 14569661 one in Sac is homey and 14569661 servers are 14569661 perfect amount of friendly and very efficient. 14569661 one in Davis is a little more hip looking with equally great food and service.
