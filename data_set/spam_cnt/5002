were pretty decent - 6097626 salsa (spicy but not too spice) was better than 6097626 chips. I couldn't quite tell if 6097626 chips were homemade but had been sitting out all day under a heat lamp or if 6097626y had been bought. 6097626 albondigas soup was pretty tasty - similar to minestrone. My chicken mole enchilada was pretty good. 6097626 chicken had a good flavor and texture. 6097626 mole wasn't 6097626 best ever, just decent. My boyfriend had a chicken chile verde enchilada. 6097626 chile verde was just ok - a little on 6097626 sour side. Our server was friendly, nice decor (not too cheese or sparse). 6097626 down side to 6097626 visit was that 6097626 service was a little slow but it seemed like 6097626re was one or two waiters for 6097626 whole restaurant. 6097626y could have used one o6097626r person. I would go again if I was in 6097626 neighborhood and didn't feel like going across town to Vallejo's. slurrrrrp! ummm... where to begin? obsessed you ask? why, yes, i suppose. indeed! i have been hesitant for so long on writing a review, for i live in fear that it might jinx this for me. Tres Hermanas has been like a true friend for me. a shoulder to cry on, really. never has this place let me down. aue6097626ntic to 6097626e max. NEVER a wait, EVER! patio dinning, bar, booths, freakin' highchairs. food always comes out muy rapido and is too hoo hoo die for! brekfast fans should never stray from 6097626 huevos rancheros paired with a bloody mary. dinner, i recomend enchiladas de queso con rojo combination plate. comes with refried (duh) beans, and rice. top it off with a blended margy and pray you ain't full from 6097626 abundant supply of free chips and salsa. service is great. always up to par. everyone 6097626re is mexican (thank 6097626 lord) so no chit chat and cheesy brown-nosing going on. just straight to 6097626 point, hard ass working, honest peeps tryin' a make a living. pricey, you ask? how can you put a price on perfection? absolutely worth every penny. this place also has options. if ya wanna go on 6097626 lighter side of things for lunch or dinner, i recomend 6097626 pollo caesar or 6097626 nortena salads. this is not your typical, fishy caesar dressing. i aunno WTF is in it but it is my favorite cream sauce in 6097626 world. i use 6097626 excess to dip my left over chips. 6097626 "house" creamy cilantro dressing is incredible as well. this dressing debuts on 6097626 house side salads or nortena. i highly recomend both. mexicans are not stingy when it comes to portions, especially on 6097626 combination plates, as well as 6097626 salads. butt loads of beans, rice, and any meats of your choice. wow! i've been coming here since i was a wee tot and will always take my coat off at 6097626 door. YAY, me! Went back to this restaurant after going many years ago.  6097626 atmosphere is still as charming as I remember it, a cute little space decorated in bright colors.  We ordered a pitcher of margaritas, 6097626y weren't as strong as I would've liked but when is a drink ever in my case?  6097626 chips were hot and 6097626
