<blockquote style="width:500px; visibility:hidden; font-size:14px">This eshop keeper was a bullneckedmartiallooking man of thirtyand he should have been of a hot temperamentforalthough it was a bitter dayhe wore no coatbut carried one slung over his shoulder His shirtsleeves were rolled uptooand his brown arms were bare to the elbows Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own crisplycurling short dark hair He was a dark man altogetherwith good eyes and a good bold breadth between them Goodhumoured looking on the wholebut implacablelookingtoo evidently a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose a man not desirable to be metrushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either sidefor nothing would turn the man

  Madame Defargehis wifesat in the shop behind the counter as he came in Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own agewith a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anythinga large hand heavily ringeda steady facestrong featuresand great composure of manner There was a character about Madame Defargefrom which one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided Madame Defarge being sensitive to coldwas wrapped in furand had a quantity of bright shawl ted about her headthough not to the concealment of her large earrings Her knitting was before herbut she had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick Thus engagedwith her right elbow supported by her left handMadame Defarge said nothing when her lord came inbut coughed just one grain of cough Thisin combination with the lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a linesuggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the shop among the customersfor any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way

  The eshop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes aboutuntil they rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young ladywho were seated in a corner Other company were there two playing cardstwo playing dominoesthree standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply of e As he passed behind the counterhe took notice that the elderly gentleman said in a look to the young ladyThis is our man

  What the devil do you do in that galley there said Monsieur Defarge to himself I dont know you

  Buthe feigned not to notice the two strangersand fell into discourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter

  How goes itJacques said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge Is all the spilt e swallowed

  Every dropJacquesanswered Monsieur Defarge

  When this interchange of Christian name was effectedMadame Defargepicking her teeth with her toothpickcoughed another grain of coughand raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line

  It is not oftensaid the second of the threeaddressing Monsieur Defargethat many of these miserable beasts know the taste of eor of anything but black bread and  Is it not soJacques

  It is soJacquesMonsieur Defarge returned

  At this second interchange of the Christian nameMadame Defargestill using her toothpick with profound composurecoughed another grain of coughand raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line
