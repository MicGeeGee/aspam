    <p>How One Woman Boosted Her Brainpower<br /> o the Christian the follo=
wing quotation will mean much. In it we hear the echo of Masefield' s The E=
verlasting Mercy; or of that marvelous story of the regeneration of a human=
 soul in Tolstoy' s The Resurrection; an old-fashioned conversion of a huma=
n being; a Paul' s on the road to Damascus experience. And the tragedy is t=
hat just about the time that the world of literature is being fascinated wi=
th this story of &quot; Rebirth&quot; the church seems to be forgetting it.=
 It is told in the first verse of Ex Tenebris--&quot; The Lay of the King W=
ho Rose Again&quot; : &quot; Take away my rage! Take away my sin! Strip me =
all bare Of that I did wear-- The foul rags, the base rags, The rude and th=
e mean! Strip me, yea strip me Right down to my skin! Strip me all bare Of =
that I have been! Then wash me in water, In fair running water, Wash me wit=
hout, And wash me within, In fair running water, In fresh running water, Wa=
sh me, ah wash me, And make me all clean! --Clean of the soilure And clean =
of the sin, --Clean of the soul-crushing Sense of defilure, --Clean of the =
old self, And clean of the sin! In fair running water, In fresh running wat=
er, In sun-running water, All sweet and all pure, Wash me, ah wash me, And =
I shall be clean.&quot; The Fiery Cross GOD AND HIS VOICE From the voice of=
 Christ and the voice of the cross it is not far to hear the voice of God e=
ither in life or in John Oxenham' s books. Behind the cross and behind the =
Christ stands the Father, and a treatment of this great poet' s writings wo=
uld not be complete if one did not quote a few excerpts from his writings t=
o show that God was ever present &quot; keeping watch above his own.&quot; =
The first note we catch of the Father' s voice is in &quot; The Call of the=
 Dead&quot; : &quot; One way there is--one only-- Whereby ye may stand sure=
; One way by which ye may understand All foes, and Life' s High Ways comman=
d, And make your building sure.--- Take God once more as Counselor, Work wi=
th Him, hand in hand, Build surely, in His Grace and Power, The nobler thin=
gs that shall endure, And, having done all--STAND!&quot; The Vision Splendi=
d. And as the poet has walked the streets of America and elsewhere and has =
seen the service flag, which in &quot; Each window shrines a name,&quot; he=
 has felt God everywhere. In &quot; The Leaves of the Golden Book&quot; he =
comforts those who mourn: &quot; God will gather all these scattered Leaves=
 into His Golden Book, Torn and crumpled, soiled and battered, He will heal=
 them with a look. Not one soul of them has perished; No man ever yet forso=
ok Wife and home, and all he cherished, And God' s purpose undertook, But h=
e met his full reward In the ' Well Done' of his Lord!&quot; The Vision Spl=
endid. So it is that over and over we hear this note, wrung from the experi=
ences of war, that those who give up all, to die for God' s plan, to take t=
he cross in suffering that the world may be better; these shall have life e=
ternal. And who dares to dispute it? In &quot; Our Share&quot; we are admon=
ished that we must find God anew: &quot; Heads of sham gold and feet of cru=
mbling clay, If we would build anew and build to stay, We must find God aga=
in, And go His way.&quot; All' s Well. Oxenham does not claim to fully unde=
rstand the world cataclysm any more than some of the rest of us. If we all =
had to understand, we might find ourselves ineligible for the Kingdom, but =
the Book says everywhere, &quot; He that believeth on me shall have everlas=
ting life.&quot; And we can believe whether we understand or no. So voices =
the poet in &quot; God' s Handwriting&quot; : &quot; He writes in character=
s too grand For our short sight to understand; We catch but broken strokes,=
 and try To fathom all the mystery Of withered hopes, of deaths, of life, T=
he endless war, the useless strife,-- But there, with larger, clearer sight=
, We shall see this-- HIS WAY WAS RIGHT.&quot; All' s Well, What better way=
 to close this brief interpretation of our poet in this day of darkness and=
 hate and hurt and war and woe and want, of seeing hopelessness and helples=
sness, than with these heartening lines from &quot; God Is&quot; : &quot; G=
od is; God sees; God loves; God knows. And Right is Right; And Right is Mig=
ht. In the full ripeness of His Time, All these His vast prepotencies Shall=
 round their grace-work to the prime Of full accomplishment, And we shall s=
ee the plan sublime Of His beneficent intent. Live on in hope! Press on in =
faith! Love conquers all things, Even Death.&quot; All' s Well. =
[Illustration: ALFRED NOYES.] VI ALFRED NOYES [Footnote: The poetical selections appea=
ring in this chapter are used by permission, and are taken from Collected P=
oems by Alfred Noyes, two volumes, copyright, 1913, by the Frederick A. Sto=
kes Company, New York.] A STUDY OF CHILDHOOD, OF MANHOOD, CHRISTHOOD, AND G=
ODHOOD If one wants to find the tenderest, most completely sympathetic stud=
y of childhood, one that finds echo not only in the heart of the grown-up, =
but in the heart of children the world over, he must this day go to Alfred =
Noyes. If you want proof of this, read &quot; The Forest of Wild Thyme&quot=
; or &quot; The Flower of Old Japan&quot; to your children and watch them s=
it with open mouths and open hearts to hear these wonder fairy tales. And, =
further, if you are too grown-up to want to read Noyes for his complete sym=
pathy with childhood, more universal even than our beloved Riley; and you w=
ant a poet that challenges you to a more vigorous manhood, a poet who calls=
 man to his highest and deepest virility, read Noyes. Or, if you happen to =
need a clearer, firmer insight into the man of Galilee and Calvary, read No=
yes; and, finally, if you want firmer, more rocklike foundations to plant y=
our faith in God upon, read Noyes, for herein one finds all of these. From =
childhood to Godhood is, indeed, a wide range for a poet to take, and yet t=
hey are akin. As another poet has said, none less than Edwin Markham, &quot=
; Know man and you will know the deep of God.&quot; And as Noyes himself sa=
ys in the introduction to &quot; The Forest of Wild Thyme&quot; : &quot; Hu=
sband, there was a happy day, Long ago in love' s young May, When, with a w=
ild-flower in your hand You echoed that dead poet' s cry-- ' Little flower,=
 but if I could understand!' And you saw it had roots in the depth of the s=
ky, And there in that smallest bud lay furled The secret and meaning of all=
 the world.&quot; Collected Poems by Alfred Noyes. And when we know that th=
e mother was talking about &quot; Little Peterkin,&quot; their lost baby, w=
e know that she meant that in a little child there lay furled &quot; The se=
cret and meaning of all the world.&quot; And so, beginning with childhood, =
through those intermediate steps of manhood and Christhood, with Noyes lead=
ing us, as he literally leads the little tots through the mysteries of Old =
Japan and the Wild Thyme, let us go from tree to tree, and flower to flower=
, and hope to hope, and pain to pain, up to God, from whence we came. It is=
 a clear sweet pathway that he leads us. CHILDHOOD AND ITS GLORY Noyes assu=
mes something that we all know for truth: that &quot; Grown-ups do not unde=
rstand&quot; childhood. But after reading this sweet poet we know that he d=
oes understand; and we thank God for him. In Part II of &quot; The Forest o=
f Wild Thyme&quot; one sees this clearly. &quot; O, grown-ups cannot unders=
tand, And grown-ups never will, How short' s the way to fairyland Across th=
e purple hill: They smile: their smile is very bland, Their eyes are wise a=
nd chill; And yet--at just a child' s command-- The world' s an Eden still.=
&quot; Collected Poems by Alfred Noyes. Thank the stars that watch over us =
in love that the great-hearted poets, and the children of the world--at lea=
st those little ones that a half-way Christian civilization has not robbed =
of childhood--know that &quot; The world' s an Eden still.&quot; From the p=
relude to &quot; The Flower of Old Japan&quot; comes that same note, like a=
 bluebird in springtime, that note of belief, of trust, of hope: &quot; Do =
you remember the blue stream; The bridge of pale bamboo; The path that seem=
ed a twisted dream Where everything came true; The purple cheery-trees; the=
 house With jutting eaves below the boughs; The mandarins in blue, With tin=
y tapping, tilted toes, With curious curved mustachios? * * * * * &quot; Ah=
, let us follow, follow far Beyond the purple seas; Beyond the rosy foaming=
 bar, The coral reef, the trees, The land of parrots and the wild That roll=
s before the fearless child In ancient mysteries: Onward, and onward if we =
can, To Old Japan, to Old Japan.&quot; Collected Poems by Alfred Noyes. And=
 &quot; The Forest of Wild Thyme&quot; is full of the echos of fairy tales =
and childhood rhymes heard the world over. Little Peterkin, who went with t=
he children to &quot; Old Japan,&quot; is dead now: &quot; Come, my brother=
 pirates, I am tired of play; Come and look for Peterkin, little brother Pe=
terkin, Our merry little comrade that the fairies took away.&quot; Collecte=
d Poems by Alfred Noyes. And so, they go to the last place they saw him, th=
e old God' s Acre, and fall asleep amid the wild thyme blooming there. As t=
hey dream the thyme grows to the size of trees, and they wander about in th=
e forest hunting for Peterkin. As they hunted they found out who killed Coc=
k Robin. They appeal to Little Boy Blue to help them hunt for Peterkin: &qu=
ot; Little Boy Blue, you are gallant and brave, There was never a doubt in =
those clear, bright eyes. Come, challenge the grim, dark Gates of the Grave=
 As the skylark sings to those infinite skies!&quot; Collected Poems by Alf=
red Noyes. The King of Fairyland gives command to Pease-Blossom: &quot; And=
 cried, Pease-blossom, Mustard-Seed! You know the old command; Well; these =
are little children; you must lead them on to Peterkin!&quot; Collected Poe=
ms by Alfred Noyes. They even discovered, as they were led on by Pease-Blos=
som and Mustard- Seed, how fairies were born: &quot; Men upon earth Bring u=
s to birth Gently at even and morn! When as brother and brother They greet =
one another And smile--then a fairy is born!&quot; Collected Poems by Alfre=
d Noyes. And, too, they found why fairies die: &quot; But at each cruel wor=
d Upon earth that is heard, Each deed of unkindness or hate, Some fairy mus=
t pass From the games in the grass And steal through the terrible Gate.&quo=
t; Collected Poems by Alfred Noyes. And they learned what it took to make a=
 rose: &quot; ' What is there hid in the heart of a rose, Mother-mine?' ' A=
h, who knows, who knows, who knows? A man that died on a lonely hill May te=
ll you perhaps, but none other will, Little child.' &quot; ' What does it t=
ake to make a rose, Mother-mine?' ' The God that died to make it knows. It =
takes the world' s eternal wars, It takes the moon and all the stars, It ta=
kes the might of heaven and hell And the everlasting Love as well, Little c=
hild.' &quot; Collected Poems by Alfred Noyes. And they heard the old tales=
 over: &quot; And ' See-Saw; Margery Daw,' we heard a rollicking shout, As =
the swing boats hurtled over our heads to the tune of the roundabout; And '=
 Little Boy Blue, come blow up your horn,' we heard the showmen cry, And ' =
Dickery Dock, I' m as good as a clock,' we heard the swings reply.&quot; Co=
llected Poems by Alfred Noyes. Then at last they found their little brother=
 Peterkin in &quot; The Babe of Bethlehem.&quot; And if this were not enoug=
h to make the reader see how completely and wholly and sympathetically Noye=
s understood the child heart, hear this word from his great soul: &quot; Ki=
nd little eyes that I love, Eyes forgetful of mine, In a dream I am bending=
 above Your sleep and you open and shine; And I know as my own grow blind W=
ith a lonely prayer for your sake, He will hear--even me--little eyes that =
were kind, God bless you, asleep or awake!&quot; Collected Poems by Alfred =
Noyes. MANHOOD AND ITS VIGOR Virility like unto steel is the very mark of N=
oyes. But as this study of Childhood has shown, it is a virility touched wi=
th tenderness. As Bayard Taylor sings: &quot; The bravest are the tenderest=
, The loving are the daring!&quot; And this is Noyes. Noyes knew Manhood, h=
e sang it, he challenged it too, he crowned it in &quot; Drake&quot; ; he p=
laced it a little lower than the gods. Hear this supreme word, enough to li=
ft man to the skies: &quot; Where, what a dreamer yet, in spite of all, Is =
man, that splendid visionary child Who sent his fairy beacon through the du=
sk!&quot; Collected Poems by Alfred Noyes. This tribute to Marlow--how eagl=
elike it is! How suggestive of heights, and mountain peaks and blue skies a=
nd far-flung stars! &quot; But he who dared the thunder-roll, Whose eagle-w=
ings could soar, Buffeting down the clouds of night, To beat against the Li=
ght of Light, That great God-blinded eagle-soul, We shall not see him more!=
&quot; Collected Poems by Alfred Noyes. Then he makes us one with all that =
is granite and flower and high and holy in &quot; The Loom of the Years&quo=
t; : &quot; One with the flower of a day, one with the withered moon, One w=
ith the granite mountains that melt into the noon, One with the dream that =
triumphs beyond the light of the spheres, We come from the Loom of the Weav=
er, that weaves the Web of the years.&quot; Collected Poems by Alfred Noyes=
 From &quot; Drake&quot; again this ringing word: &quot; His face was like=
 a king' s face as he spake, For sorrows that strike deep reveal the deep; =
And through the gateways of a ragged wound Sometimes a God will drive his c=
hariot wheels From some deep heaven within the hearts of men!&quot; Collect=
ed Poems by Alfred Noyes. CHRISTHOOD AND ITS CALVARY From childhood to manh=
ood through Christhood to Godhood is a progression that Noyes sees clearly =
and makes us see as clearly. Somehow Christ is very real to Noyes. He is no=
t a historical character far off. He is the Christ of here and now; the Chr=
ist that meets our every need; as real as a dearly beloved friend next door=
 to us. No poet sees the Christ more clearly. First he caught the meanings =
of Christ' s gospel of new birth. He was not confused on that. He knows: &q=
uot; The task is hard to learn While all the songs of Spring return Along t=
he blood and sing. &quot; Yet hear--from her deep skies, How Art, for all y=
our pain, still cries, _Ye must be born again_!&quot; Collected Poems by Al=
fred Noyes. And who could put his worship more beautifully than the poet do=
es in &quot; The Symbolist&quot; ? &quot; Help me to seek that unknown land=
! I kneel before the shrine. Help me to feel the hidden hand That ever hold=
eth mine. &quot; I kneel before the Word, I kneel Before the Cross of flame=
 I cry, as through the gloom I steal, The glory of the Name.&quot; Collect=
ed Poems by Alfred Noyes. Christ' s face, and his life experiences, here an=
d there slip out of the lines of this English poet with an insistence that =
cannot but win the heart of the world, especially the heart of the Christia=
n. Here and there in the most unexpected places his living presence stands =
before you, with, to use another of the poet' s own lines, &quot; Words tha=
t would make the dead arise,&quot; as in &quot; Vicisti, Galilee&quot; : &q=
uot; Poor, scornful Lilliputian souls, And are ye still too proud To risk y=
our little aureoles By kneeling with the crowd? * * * * * &quot; And while =
ye scoff, on every side Great hints of Him go by,--Souls that are hourly cr=
ucified On some new Calvary!&quot; * * * * * &quot; In flower and dust, in =
chaff and grain, He binds Himself and dies! We live by His eternal pain, Hi=
s hourly sacrifice.&quot; * * * * * &quot; And while ye scoff from shore to=
 shore From sea to moaning sea, ' Eloi, eloi,' goes up once more, ' Lama sa=
bachthani!' The heavens are like a scroll unfurled, The writing flames abov=
e-- This is the King of all the World Upon His Cross of Love!&quot; Collect=
ed Poems by Alfred Noyes. And there in the very midst of &quot; Drake,&quot=
; that poem of a great sea fighter, comes this quatrain unexpectedly, showi=
ng the Christ always in the background of the poet' s mind. He uses the Chr=
ist eagerly as a figure, as a help to his thought. He always puts the Chris=
t and his cross to the fore: &quot; Whence came the prentice carpenter whos=
e voice Hath shaken kingdoms down, whose menial gibbet Rises triumphant o' =
er the wreck of Empires And stretches out its arms amongst the Stars?&quot;=
 Collected Poems by Alfred Noyes. Then in &quot; The Old Skeptic&quot; we h=
ear these of the Christ in the concluding lines: &quot; I will go back to m=
y home and look at the wayside flowers, And hear from the wayside cabin the=
 kind old hymns again, Where Christ holds out His arms in the quiet evening=
 hours, And the light of the chapel porches broods on the peaceful lane. &q=
uot; And there I shall hear men praying the deep old foolish prayers, And t=
here I shall see once more, the fond old faith confessed, And the strange o=
ld light on their faces who hear as a blind man hears-- ' Come unto me, ye =
weary, and I will give you rest.' &quot; I will go back and believe in the =
deep old foolish tales, And pray the simple prayers that I learned at my mo=
ther' s knee, Where the Sabbath tolls its peace, through the breathless mou=
ntain-vales, And the sunset' s evening hymn hallows the listening sea.&quot=
; Collected Poems by Alfred Noyes. GODHOOD AT LAST AND SURELY He finds God.=
 There is no uncertainty about it. From childhood to Godhood has the poet c=
ome, and we have come with him. It has been a triumphant journey upward. Bu=
t we have not been afraid. Even the blinding light of God' s face has not m=
ade us tremble. We have learned to know him through this climb upward and u=
pward to his throne. At first it was uncertain. The poet had to challenge u=
s to one great end in &quot; The Paradox&quot; : &quot; But one thing is ne=
edful; and ye shall be true To yourself and the goal and the God that ye se=
ek; Yea, the day and the night shall requite it to you If ye love one anoth=
er, if your love be not weak!&quot; Collected Poems by Alfred Noyes. For he=
 knew the heart hunger for God that was in every human breast: &quot; I am =
full-fed, and yet I hunger! Who set this fiercer famine in my maw? Who set =
this fiercer hunger in my heart?&quot; Collected Poems by Alfred Noyes. Fro=
m &quot; Drake&quot; comes that scintillating line: &quot; A scribble of Go=
d' s finger in the sky&quot; ; and an admonition to the preacher: &quot; Th=
ou art God' s minister, not God' s oracle!&quot; Nor did he forget that man=
, in his search for God, is, after all, but man, and weak! So from &quot; T=
ales of a Mermaid Tavern&quot; : &quot; ... and of that other Ocean Where a=
ll men sail so blindly, and misjudge Their friends, their charts, their sto=
rms, their stars, their _God!_&quot; Collected Poems by Alfred Noyes. Even =
like unto &quot; Bo' sin Bill,&quot; who was and is a prevalent type, but n=
ot a serious type--that man who claims to be an atheist, but in times of st=
ress, like unto us all, turns to God. And what humorous creatures we are! E=
nough to make God smile, if he did not love us so much: &quot; But our bo' =
sin Bill was an atheist still Ex-cept--sometimes--in the dark!&quot; Collec=
ted Poems by Alfred Noyes. And again from &quot; The Paradox&quot; : &quot;=
 Flashing forth as a flame, The unnameable Name, The ineffable Word, _I am =
the Lord_!&quot; &quot; I am the End to which the whole world strives: Ther=
efore are ye girdled with a wild desire and shod With sorrow; for among you=
 all no soul Shall ever cease, or sleep, or reach its goal Of union and com=
munion with the Whole Or rest content with less than being God.&quot; Colle=
cted Poems by Alfred Noyes. And thus we find God, with Noyes. And I have sa=
ved for the last quotation one from &quot; The Origin of Life,&quot; which =
the poet says is &quot; Written in answer to certain scientific theories.&q=
uot; I save it for the last because, strangely, it sums up all the journey =
that we have passed through, from childhood to God-hood: &quot; Watched the=
 great hills like clouds arise and set, And one--named Olivet; When you hav=
e seen as a shadow passing away, One child clasp hands and pray; When you h=
ave seen emerge from that dark mire One martyr ringed with fire; Or, from t=
hat Nothingness, by special grace One woman' s love-lit face....&quot; * * =
* * * &quot; Dare you re-kindle then, One faith for faithless men, And say =
you found, on that dark road you trod, In the beginning, _God_?&quot; Colle=
cted Poems by Alfred Noyes. [Illustration: JOHN MASEFIELD.] VII JOHN MASEFI=
ELD, POET FOR THE PULPIT [Footnote: The poetical selections appearing in th=
is chapter are used by permission, and are taken from the following works: =
The Everlasting Mercy and the Widow in the Bye Street, Salt Water Poems and=
 Ballads, and Good Friday, published by The Macmillan Company, New York.] T=
o climb is to achieve. We like to see men achieve; and the harder that achi=
evement is, the more we thrill to it. For that reason we all have a hope to=
 climb a Shasta, or a Whitney, or a Hood to its whitest peak, and glory in =
the achievement. And because of this human delight in the climb we thrill t=
o see a man climb out of sin, or out of difficulty, or out of defeat to tri=
umph. From &quot; bar-boy&quot; to poet is a great achievement, a great cli=
mb, or leap, or lift, whichever figure you may prefer, but that is exactly =
what John Masefield did. Perhaps Hutton' s figure may describe it better--&=
quot; The Leap to God.&quot; At least ten years ago John Masefield, a wande=
rer on the face of the earth, found himself in New York city without friend=
s and without means, and it was not to him an unusual thing to accept the p=
osition of &quot; bar-boy&quot; in a New York saloon. This particular profe=
ssion has within its scope the duties of wiping the beer bottles, sweeping =
the floor, and other menial tasks. And now John Masefield has within recent=
 months come to New York city to be the lauded and feted. Newspaper reporte=
rs met him as his boat landed, eager for his every word; Carnegie Hall was =
crowded to hear him read from his own poetry; and his journey across the co=
untry was just a great triumph from New York to San Francisco. Something ha=
d happened in those ten years. This man had achieved. This poet had climbed=
 to God. This man had experienced the &quot; Soul' s Leap to God.&quot; He =
had found that Man of all men who once said, &quot; If I be lifted up, I wi=
ll draw all men unto me.&quot; He always lifts men out of nothing into the =
glory of the greatest achievement. Yes, something had happened in those ten=
 years. And the things that had happened in those ten years are perfectly a=
