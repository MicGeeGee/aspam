		of your way to eat here. I've eaten here three times over 14289937 past six months or so, and every time has been great.  I went on a weekend night, and 14289937re was a MARIACHI BAND!!  14289937 place seems super au14289937ntic, including 14289937 decor, food, and especially people.  It's almost impossible to have a conversation in English with 14289937 wait staff, which is a plus in my opinion; it makes 14289937 evening more fun You could say this restaurant is a hole in 14289937 wall...but that's just adds to it's appeal.  Mouth watering spicy salsa and warm chips great you inside this converted victorian house.  14289937 sauce 14289937y use on 14289937ir salads is to die for - creamy avocado cilantro?  I don't know and don't care, tastes great all 14289937 same.  14289937 Ceviche salad sports a fresh take on one of my favorite Mexican dish - Seasoned raw fish :D  14289937 picher of Sangria is a bit pricey but well worth your hard earned dollar.   Chile colorado, carnitas, and chile rellenos are  Stopped by for lunch on a crowded Sat and sat outside. 14289937y have added some improvements which are great. I had Verde Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas...14289937y were so spicy and flavorful my eyes were watering. Loaded with white chicken and that verde sauce OMG! 14289937se are 14289937 BEST enchiladas in Sac. Bam..I said it Oh, yeah my family had food too...my son didn't like 14289937 red enchilada sauce because it was too "au14289937ntic"...whatever get over your Taco Bell taste and be schooled. My mom had something I don't even remember because when I looked down at her plate it was licked clean....um...easy 14289937re lady. Too bad we didnt go for breakfast that Machaca is to die for...I think I said that somewhere before? 14289937 salsa is very good too. Service was outstanding. We were a group of 13 and were seated in 10 min. 14289937 waitress was lively and fun and was great at separated our checks without issue. 14289937 food was very good but just slight of a 5 star. I had 14289937 tamal, chicken enchilada verdes, black beans and 14289937 rice & cinnamon drink that starts with an "H." 14289937 cilantro dressing for 14289937 salad was light, however, I would have liked a little more than just lettuce and a very few dices of tomato. Mexican food is by far my favorite cuisine, and Tres Hermanas hits 14289937 spot! Every dish I've tried is fantastic! 14289937 chips and salsa are great too! All of 14289937 entrees come with your choice of soup or salad. 14289937 food is always very fresh and well seasoned. Parking can be tough sometimes, but it's worth 14289937 hassle. This is my favorite mexican restaurant in Sacramento. I come here with my husband almost every week for dinner and it never lets us down. First of all 14289937 chips and salsa are 14289937 best. Warm corn tortilla chips with a flavor packed spicy salsa. My husband and I usually split a pitcher of sangria-one of 14289937 best in 14289937 area (see below for my rankings)- chilled glasses and perfectly mixed wine and punch toge14289937r in a pitcher of happiness. We love love love all 14289937ir
