-->And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him

  Ah returned Miss Prossshaking her head But I dont say he dont refer to it within himself

  Do you believe that he thinks of it much

  I dosaid Miss Pross

  Do you imagine Mr Lorry had begunwhen Miss Pross took him up short with

  Never imagine anything Have no imagination at all

  I stand corrected do you supposeyou go so far as to supposesometimes

  Now and thensaid Miss Pross

  Do you supposeMr Lorry went onwith a laughing tkle in his bright eyeas it looked kindly at herthat Doctor Manette has any theory of his ownpreserved through all those yearsrelative to the cause of his being so oppressed perhapseven to the name of his oppressor

  I dont suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me

  And that is

  That she thinks he has

  Now dont be angry at my asking all these questions because I am a mere dull man of businessand you are a woman of business

  Dull Miss Pross inquiredwith placidity

  Rather wishing his modest adjective awayMr Lorry repliedNonono Surely not To return to businessIs it not remarkable that Doctor Manetteunquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured he isshould never touch upon that question I will not say with methough he had business relations with me many years agoand we are now intimate I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly attachedand who is so devotedly attached to him Believe meMiss ProssI dont approach the topic with youout of curiositybut out of zealous interest

  Well To the best of my understandingand bads the bestyoull tell mesaid Miss Prosssoftened by the tone of the apologyhe is afraid of the whole subject

  Afraid

  Its plain enoughI should thinkwhy he may be Its a dreadful remembrance Besides thathis loss of himself grew out of it Not knog how he lost himselfor how he recovered himselfhe may never feel certain of not losing himself again That alone wouldnt make the subject pleasantI should think

  It was a profounder remark than Mr Lorry had looked for Truesaid heand fearful to reflect upon Yeta doubt lurks in my mindMiss Prosswhether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression always shut up within him Indeedit is this doubt and the uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence

  Cant be helpedsaid Miss Prossshaking her head Touch that stringand he instantly changes for the worse Better leave it alone In shortmust leave it alonelike or no like Sometimeshe gets up in the  of the nightand will be heardby us overhead therewalking up and downwalking up and downin his room Ladybird has learnt to know then that his mind is walking up and downwalking up and downin his old prison She hurries to himand they go on togetherwalking up and downwalking up and downuntil he is composed But he never says a word of the true reason of his restlessnessto herand she finds it best not to hint at it to him In silence they go walking up and down togetherwalking up and down togethertill her love and company have brought him to himself

  Notwithstanding Miss Prosss denial of her own imaginationthere was a perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad ideain her repetition of the phrasewalking up and downwhich testified to her possessing such a thing

  The corner has been mentioned as a derful corner for echoes it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feetthat it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going
