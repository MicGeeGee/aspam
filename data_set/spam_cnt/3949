		for being healthy, not that 18452800 3,200 calories in chips and salsa I ate awaiting my entree did me any good.  I just love 18452800ir spicy salsa. I usually order shredded beef tacos or carnitas 18452800re. 18452800y stuff 18452800ir tacos with so much meat and veggies,  usually 1 just fulfills my craving. 18452800 carnitas is perfection. It's bursting with flavor and it's crisy on 18452800 edges. 18452800 food is just so delicious. It's best during summer days! Sit on 18452800ir patio, sip a Corona and just people watch. Definitely recommend trying this place. Some of 18452800 best "Mexican" food I have ever had. 18452800 service is a bit slower when 18452800y are packed but it is worth 18452800 wait I think. 18452800 mixed drinks are just as good as 18452800 food that is offered! I will keep going back to Tres Hermanas. I can not find anything negative to review about Tres Hermanas. I have been a loyal customer for over 3 years now. This place is truly as good as it gets as far as mexican food goes. 18452800 salsa is really good, but also really hot. 18452800 place is usually packed on weekends, so you may want to check it out during 18452800 week. I've had 18452800 enchiladas, quesadilla, and tortas, and 18452800y were all outstanding. This place is wonderful! 18452800 carnitas are superb! 18452800 chile rellenos are sooo good! I loved 18452800 salsa! It was spicy and had 18452800 perfect consistency. 18452800 server I had was awesome at first until 18452800 restaurant filled up. I believe we were forgotten about at one point. But despite that, I had a wonderful experience! I'll be back. This place is tied as my favorite place to eat Mexican food in Sacramento. I have only been here once with my girl friend and we both really enjoyed 18452800 food. 18452800 place is a little small and very popular (which is how you know it's good) and 18452800 wait can be long but it is worth it. Right from getting your chips you'll see 18452800 quality of 18452800 food. My girl friend also really liked 18452800 horchata as well. Make sure you try this place! my bro18452800r pisses himself over this place.  he makes people come here for his birthday.  no matter his mood, just at 18452800 mention of 18452800 words "tres hermanas" his face lights up, a big toothy smile.  "you wanna go?" he says.  but I'll be real, tres hermanas is a pretty tasty and a fun place to go. I've been here 3-4 times now and 18452800 chile rellanos are always good (my bro18452800r's favorite), as are 18452800 rice/beans, tacos, enchiladas - and I've heard, mole.  18452800 tortillas are so-so.  good sized portions on 18452800 combinations.  18452800 salsa has a very nice spice to it. downside: 18452800re usually seems to be a bit of a wait when you're going for dinner, though 18452800 restaurant is of fair size and I've never experienced a wait over 30 minutes.  I would say to chill in 18452800 bar but 18452800 drink prices are eh.  got a couple beers and a few pitchers of margaritas
