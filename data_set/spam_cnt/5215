  At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burialgroundwith a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it it was a poor figure in wooddone by some inexperienced rustic carverbut he had studied the figure from the lifehis own lifemaybefor it was dreadfully spare and thin

  To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been grog worseand was not at its worsta woman was kneeling She turned her head as the carriage came up to herrose quicklyand presented herself at the carriagedoor

  It is youMonseigneur Monseigneura petition

  With an exclamation of impatiencebut with his unchangeable faceMonseigneur looked out

  Howthen What is it Always petitions

  Monseigneur For the love of the great God My husbandthe forester

  What of your husbandthe forester Always the same with you people He cannot pay something

  He has paid allMonseigneur He is 

  Well He is quiet Can I restore him to you

  AlasnoMonseigneur But he lies yonderunder a little heap of poor grassMonseigneurthere are so many little heaps of poor grass

  Againwell

  She looked an old womanbut was young Her manner was one of passionate grief by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energyand laid one of them on the carriagedoortenderlycaressinglyas if it had been a human and could be expected to feel the appealing touch

  Monseigneurhear me Monseigneurhear my petition My husband died of want so many die of want so many more will die of want

  Againwell Can I feed them

  Monseigneurthe good God knows but I dont ask it My petition isthat a morsel of stone or woodwith my husbands namemay be placed over him to show where he lies Otherwisethe place will be quickly forgottenit will never be found when I am  of the same maladyI shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass Monseigneurthey are so manythey increase so fastthere is so much want Monseigneur Monseigneur

  The valet had put her away from the doorthe carriage had broken into a brisk trotthe postilions had quickened the paceshe was left far behindand Monseigneuragain escorted by the Furieswas rapidly diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and his chateau

  The sweet scents of the summer night rose all around himand roseas the rain fallsimpartiallyon the dustyraggedand toilworn group at the fountain not far away to whom the mender of roadswith the aid of the blue cap without which he was nothingstill enlarged upon his man like a spectreas long as they could bear it By degreesas they could bear no morethey dropped off one by oneand lights tkled in little casements which lightsas the casements darkenedand more stars came outseemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having been extinguished

  The shadow of a large highroofed houseand of many overhanging treeswas upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time and the shadow was exchanged for the light of a flambeauas his carriage stoppedand the great door of his chateau was opened to him

  Monsieur Charleswhom I expect is he arrived from England

It was a heavy mass of buildingthat chateau of Monsieur the Marquiswith a large stone courtyard before itand two stone sweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door A stony business altogetherwith heavy stone balustradesand stone urnsand stone flowersand stone faces of menand stone heads of lionsin all directions As if the Gorgons head had surveyed itwhen it was finishedtwo centuries ago

  Up the broad flight of shallow stepsMonsieur the Marquisflambeau precededwent from his carriagesufficiently disturbing the darkness to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile of stable building away among the trees All else was so quietthat the flambeau carried up the stepsand the other flambeau held at the great doorburnt as if they were in a close room of stateinstead of being in the open nightair Other sound than the owls voice there was nonesave the falling of a fountain into its stone basin forit was one of those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour togetherand then heave a long low sighand hold their breath again

  The great door clanged behind himand Monsieur the Marquis crossed a hall grim with certain old boarspearsswordsand knives of the chase grimmer with certain heavy ridingrods and ridingwhipsof which many a peasantgone to his benefactor had felt the  when his lord was angry

  Avoiding the larger roomswhich were dark and made fast for the nightMonsieur the Marquiswith his flambeaubearer going on beforewent up the staircase to a door in a corridor This thrown openadmitted him to his own private apartment of three rooms his bedchamber and two others High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floorsgreat dogs upon the hearths for the burning of wood in ter timeand all luxuries befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country The fashion of the last Louis but oneof the line that was never to breakthe fourteenth Louiswas conspicuous in their rich furniture butit was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old pages in the history of France

  A suppertable was laid for twoin the third of the rooms a round roomin one of the chateaus four extinguishertopped towers A small lofty roomwith its dow wide openand the wooden jalousieblinds closedso that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of blackalternating with their broad lines of stone colour

  My nephewsaid the Marquisglancing at the supper preparation they said he was not arrived

  Nor was he buthe had been expected with Monseigneur

  Ah It is not probable he will arrive tonight neverthelessleave the table as it is I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour

  In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was readyand sat down alone to his sumptuous and choice supper His chair was opposite to the dowand he had taken his soupand was raising his glass of Bordeaux to his lipswhen he put it down

  What is that he calmly askedlooking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour
 Monseigneur That

  Outside the blinds Open the blinds

  It was done

  Well

  Monseigneurit is nothing The trees and the night are all that are here

  The servant who spokehad thrown the blinds widehad looked out into the vacant darknessand stood with that blank behind himlooking round for instructions

  Goodsaid the imperturbable master Close them again

  That was done tooand the Marquis went on with his supper He was half way through itwhen he again stopped with his glass in his handhearing the sound of wheels It came on brisklyand came up to the front of the chateau

  Ask who is arrived

  It was the nephew of Monseigneur He had been some few leagues behind Monseigneurearly in the afternoon He had diminished the distance rapidlybut not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road He had heard of Monseigneurat the postinghousesas being before him

  He was to be told said Monseigneur that supper awaited him then and thereand that he was prayed to come to it In a little while he came He had been known in England as Charles Darnay

  Monseigneur received him in a courtly mannerbut they did not shake hands

  You left Paris yesterdaysir he said to Monseigneuras he took his seat at table
