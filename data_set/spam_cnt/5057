The biggest concerns that are floated when debating wired v wireless networks are security and speed. It has to be said that in both instances wired is superior. However, having said that, although wired has a clear edge, that doesn't mean to say that wireless is either insecure, or slow.

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">For those businesses where superfast speed and ultra secure methodology are not critically important, going wireless has many advantages to offer.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">ADVANTAGE # 1 - INCREASED MOBILITY</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Increased mobility is by far the biggest attraction that wireless networking holds for most businesses. Being able to sit at any terminal, anywhere in the building and access the server is a great advantage.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">When laptops were developed, because of the new mobility convenience factor that they brought within them, this gave added impetus to the advantages of being able to work anywhere within range of the wireless network signal. It means that not only can employees now access information from the server, wherever they are in the premises, but it also enables colleagues to collaborate and share information in meetings held anywhere; either in a corner of the office, a bespoke meeting room, or even the staff canteen. It enables total mobility.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">ADVANTAGE # 2 - ENABLING BYOD</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The increased mobility factor both enables and facilitates the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) phenomenon, which more and more businesses are now taking advantage of. Laptops, Tablets, and Smartphones that belong to individual employees are now being brought into the workplace and are being given access rights to the wireless network. As well, as making it more convenient for employees to carry out their tasks, BYOD also represents a potential cost saving, as businesses no longer have to fund the hardware cost of the devices themselves.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">ADVANTAGE # 3 - INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Another important by-product of the increased mobility factor is that it promotes increased productivity, allowing employees to collaborate where and when they need to. It brings freedom of operation and speeds up the working process. But there is another factor too, and that is that employees take their device's home with them, and can work, (as many do), in their own time when it's convenient to do so.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">ADVANTAGE # 4 - PUBLIC WI-FI - HOTSPOTS</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Wireless networking has also gone into the public domain, with Wi-Fi hotspots being available in many high street coffee shops, hotels, railway stations, airports, universities, hospitals, etc. It enables people to get onto the Internet when they're away from the office, or away from home. People can pick up their emails, both social and business, and if their place of work allows, can also connect into the business network remotely.</p>
