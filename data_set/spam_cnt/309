      <td bgcolor="#F2ECF0" style="color:#F2ECF0; font-size:12px">He was taken from the kindergarten His nurse Nana in her starched gingham dress became the centre of his tiny world On bright days they walked in the park Nana would point at a great gray monster and say elephant and Benjamin would say it after her and when he was being undressed for bed that night he would say it over and over aloud to her Elyphant elyphant elyphant Sometimes Nana let him jump on the bed which was fun because if you sat down exactly right it would bounce you up on your feet again and if you said Ah for a long time while you jumped you got a very pleasing broken vocal effect

He loved to take a big cane from the hatrack and go around hitting chairs and tables with it and saying Fight fight fight When there were people there the old ladies would cluck at him which interested him and the young ladies would try to kiss him which he submitted to with mild boredom And when the long day was done at five oclock he would go upstairs with Nana and be fed on oatmeal and nice soft mushy foods with a spoon

There were no troublesome memories in his ish sleep no token came to him of his brave days at college of the glittering years when he flustered the hearts of many girls There were only the white safe walls of his crib and Nana and a man who came to see him sometimes and a great big orange ball that Nana pointed at just before his twilight bed hour and called sun When the sun went his eyes were sleepythere were no dreams no dreams to haunt him

The pastthe wild charge at the head of his men up San Juan Hill the first years of his marriage when he worked late into the summer dusk down in the busy city for young Hildegarde whom he loved the days before that when he sat smoking far into the night in the gloomy old on house on Monroe Street with his grandfatherall these had faded like unsubstantial dreams from his mind as though they had never been He did not remember

He did not remember clearly whether the milk was warm or cool at his last feeding or how the days pedthere was only his crib and Nanas familiar presence And then he remembered nothing When he was hungry he criedthat was all Through the noons and nights he breathed and over him there were soft mumblings and murmurings that he scarcely heard and faintly differentiated smells and light and darkness

Then it was all dark and his white crib and the dim faces that moved above him and the warm sweet aroma of the milk faded out altogether from his mind
