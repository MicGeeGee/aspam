I finally had a Sunday off and wanted to chill.  I always heard about the Sunday brunch and wanted to try the Kimchee Fried rice and... Great ambiance, great cocktails, good movies on TV, good food. Don't miss their cheese board with pickled veggies. Yum! ..Weekend evenings and happy hour... I love the combo lamb plate...It's a perfect balance of salad, rice, lamb and finishing off with Baklava. ..Hidden gem in Oakland !
