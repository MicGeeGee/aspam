<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and Roth IRAs</p>

<!-- Paragraph 1 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">When considering an IRA, the major distinction is between the traditional IRA and the Roth IRA. An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) provides certain tax advantages, and anyone who wants to save for retirement can set one up.  It is funded solely by your own money.  This differs from the 401(k), which is connected to your workplace and typically includes contributions made by your employer.</p>

<!-- Paragraph 2 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">With a traditional IRA, the taxes are paid when you withdraw the money (in retirement), whereas with a Roth IRA, the taxes are paid up front. There are also limits to contributing to  IRAs.</p>

<!-- Paragraph 3 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">One element that must be taken into account is that funds must be held in a Roth IRA for five years or more, or a 10 percent tax penalty will be paid on any taxable earnings withdrawn.  However, the benefits of a Roth IRA can be considerable.  If you keep the funds in your Roth IRA for five years or more and make a withdrawal after you reach age 59 and a half, then your withdrawals are not taxable at all.</p>

<!-- Paragraph 4 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Another benefit of a Roth IRA is that contributions can continue as long as the person is still earning income.  For a traditional IRA, contributions have to stop after age 70 and a half.</p>
