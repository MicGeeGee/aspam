The only thing that prevents me... It's all good! Staff and food are both wonderful! Plenty to choose from the menu. From hamburgers to gyros and a good list of appetizers. The food is... Tried teriyaki children ..Pineapple chicken ..Egg roll..Satay chicken ....Teriyaki 10+  tasty tiny bit spicy. Not too spicy. Great chicken and paper thin carrot... Awesom food and reasonably priced, I would stop here anytime. Only drawback is the seating So make sure you go before 5pm. Great Chinese for relatively small town.  Note well. Apple Maps has this location completely wrong.  If you use the map function any yelp it will take you... Finally got to eat at RRG. Phenomenal! It's a little tricky to find \u0026 from the outside looks to be on the smaller side but it surprises when you enter. I... I had the saut\u00e9ed chicken and a small Cesar salad it was very enjoyable I would very much recommend it to all the local people.

Everytime we come back to visit my wifes family in the area I ask to visit El Charro.  I get the green chilie pork, awesome. The worst Dennys I've ever been to. The waitresses were rude, the cups and silverware were dirty and the fluffy pancakes were thin and tough. I appreciate local businesses because they support the local economy, so I try to spend my money local, but this place is almost unbearable.  ..I had tried...f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
