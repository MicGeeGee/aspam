Olive oil, lots of cheese, and pesto and tomato goodness. I was supposed to leave town and stayed an extra day just to have some local fish.  I used to live in the area and couldn't imagine leaving without enjoying... Such a charming gem. The beer is cold and the food is delicious.  Service was great and we will definitely be making another stop next time we're in town. We were on a road trip through the Northern Midwest in June, 2016. By the time we hit Fitzgerald's (and stayed at Eagle River Inn), we had been on the road... Perfect service, great menu and quality food.  Who could ask for more?  Had a party of 10 with no problems. Excellent brunch here on Sundays! I got the strawberry crepes. The crepes were crispy and light, filled with juicy strawberries and the sweetest cream... Nice come as you are place to eat. Tu</p>
