<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Have you been wanting to travel but can't afford it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Today, there are amazingly cheap flights to places like London, New York, Los Angeles, and anywhere else in the world.</span></p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">1. Be Flexible with Your Travel Dates<br />Airline ticket prices vary depending on the day of the week, time of year, and upcoming holidays such as Christmas, New Year's Eve, Thanksgiving, or the Fourth of July. Overseas, August is a big month for traveling around Europe as many Europeans go on vacation then, so airline tickets tend to be higher.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">It's always cheaper to fly during the middle of the week than on a weekend, because most people travel on the weekends and airlines hike their prices then. Prices are also a bit cheaper if you fly after a major holiday. Early-morning or late-night flights are cheaper because fewer people want to travel then. Before you commit to your departure, make sure you check other dates so as to pick the cheapest day. If you are not flexible on the dates you want to fly, you will never be able to find a cheap flight. Even the difference of one day can mean hundreds of dollars in savings.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">2. Be Flexible with Your Destinations<br />Instead of going to a place with an expensive flight, go where it is cheaper to get there. Kayak offers the Explore tool that allows you to put in your home airport and see what routes have the cheapest fares. Google Flights also has a similar (and better) feature. If you are flexible with where you want to go (i.e., anywhere but home), these are wonderful tools to start your planning with.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">There's always a deal to some destination around the world and if you're flexible on where you want to go, you'll be able to find a deal. Use these tools to figure out where they current deals are.</p>
