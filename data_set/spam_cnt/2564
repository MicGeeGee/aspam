years that was merely a coincidence He didnt call it a particularly curious coincidence most coincidences were 
curious Neither did he call it a curious coincidence that true patriotism was his only motive too He was a true 
Britonand hoped there were many like him    The blueflies buzzed againand Mr AttorneyGeneral called Mr Jarvis 
Lorry    Mr Jarvis Lorryare you a clerk in Tellsons bank    I am    On a certain Friday night in November one  
seven  and seventyfivedid business occasion you to travel between London and Dover by the mail    It did    Were 
there any other passengers in the mail    Two    Did they alight on the road in the course of the night    They 
did    Mr Lorrylook upon the prisoner Was he one of those two passengers    I cannot undertake to say that he 
was    Does he resemble either of these two passengers    Both were so wrapped upand the night was so darkand we 
were all so reservedthat I cannot undertake to say even that    Mr Lorrylook again upon the prisoner Supposing 
him wrapped up as those two passengers wereis there anything in his bulk and stature to render it unlikely that 
he was one of them    No    You will not swearMr Lorrythat he was not one of them    No    So at least you say he 
may have been one of them    Yes Except that I remember them both to have beenlike myselftimorous of 
highwaymenand the prisoner has not a timorous air    Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidityMr Lorry    I 
certainly have seen that    Mr Lorrylook once more upon the prisoner Have you seen himto your certain 
knowledgebefore    I have    When    I was returning from France a few days afterwardsandat Calaisthe prisoner 
came on board the packetship in which I returnedand made the voyage with me    At what hour did he come on 
board    At a little after midnight    In the  of the night Was he the only passenger who came on board at that 
untimely hour    He happened to be the only one    Never mind about happeningMr Lorry He was the only passenger 
who came on board in the  of the night    He was    Were you travelling aloneMr Lorryor with any companion    
With two companions A gentleman and lady They are here    They are here Had you any conversation with the

where she had sat Her father rose with herand kept her hand drawn through his arm    Miss Manettelook upon the 
prisoner    To be confronted with such pityand such earnest youth and beautywas far more trying to the accused 
than to be confronted with all the crowd Standingas it wereapart with her on the edge of his gravenot all the 
staring curiosity that looked oncouldfor the momentnerve him to remain quite still His hurried right hand 
parcelled out the herbs before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden and his efforts to control and
