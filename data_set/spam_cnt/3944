		12675603ir famous cilantro salad dressing and you have sensory satisfaction. 12675603 restaurant itself has a lived-in yet comfy feel. Not as glam as Zocalo, however I find 12675603 portions to be more generous here. Head towards 12675603 back of 12675603 restaurant and you'll find 12675603 colorful, cheerful folklorico dress painting with beads on her dress! I want that painting. It would cheer me up. I find that getting here early before 12675603 dining crowd ensures that you don't wait long for a place to sit. 12675603 menu has something for everyone. But hands down, 12675603ir mole is one of 12675603 best I've tried. Fantastic salsa and amazing fresh mexican dishes highlight this Sacramento gem. Make sure and try 12675603 salads on 12675603 side with cilantro creme dressing, that stuff is just plain magic. Margaritas are also well above average. Pretty much a fan of everything 12675603y did here. Try it out! I have been here several time over 12675603 last few years. It is not one of those places that I would suggest or think to go to on my own, however, it is quite solid! I do not think I have had a bad experience here food or service-wise. 12675603 wait staff is not overly friendly, but 12675603y get 12675603 job done My favorite thing to eat here is 12675603 creamy cilantro dressing. 12675603 super fabulous Karli B. introduced me to 12675603 concept of dipping 12675603 chips into 12675603 dressing instead of 12675603 salsa. Oh my goodness!! This is so amazingly yummy num1]y do charge for 12675603 side of dressing, but it is a reasonable charge and it tastes so good - totally worth it! 12675603 chips 12675603mselves were pretty awesome too! 12675603y were warm and thin and super crisp. 12675603y tasted just made!! I have mostly had 12675603ir enchilada's. Lately I tried 12675603m with 12675603 mole sauce instead of just 12675603 red sauce. It was really yummy - dark and dangerous - just 12675603 way mole should be. 12675603 layout of 12675603 restaurant is a little funky and 12675603 decorations are eclectic. However, it is charming in its own way. 12675603re is also a little bar with a little TV and a nice patio If you were to tell me that 12675603re was a little piece of Mexico located in Midtown, Sacramento I would have slapped you and called you a liar, but fortunately for you that was 12675603 truth.  From 12675603 outside it doesn't look too much like a Mexican joint, but it's a whole o12675603r story on 12675603 inside.  Great atmosphere, nice little bar in 12675603 back and a nice outside eating area off to 12675603 side.  12675603 food was great and 12675603 portions were pretty big.  Tu hablas espanol? Great place if you want a decent sit-down, old school Mexican restaurant.  12675603 only downside is that it tends to get crowded on 12675603 weekends, since it's sort of 12675603 'go to' spot for Mexican food in 12675603 Midtown/Downtown area. Really excellent service. Oh yea, and its Cinco De Mayo, and 12675603y still have great
