But definitely worth the wait!! We were driving from Milwaukee to Minneapolis and we found this place quite by accident (on yelp!). We hadn't really had breakfast, or lunch, so we were... Wow! That is all I can say. I got the Prosciutto Crusted Filet and it was amazing. As soon as I saw prosciutto I was sold and it didn't disappoint. So glad... Still the only place that matters in Eau Claire.  Well....here and Poblanita but that's it. Decided to stop by after being extremely bored at the hotel I was staying. I walked in not expecting to much from this place and left with unforgettable... My wife and I went on a good walk by the river and found ourselves enjoying a Farmer's Daughter summer ale...okay two! :)..We moved on to brat bites.... I have to renew my review. I have stopped into shang</p>

I have stopped into shanghai four or five since last review. Sushi has been excellent. Quality, product amount, and presentation... If you are looking for a place to get breakfast in Eau Claire, Randy's is your place. Stopped here on the way to Milwaukee from Minneapolis and it was... I spent a week visiting my dad who was in the hospital across the street and made my way over to Mancino's.....The sandwiches were decent.... slightly better... Nawabs never disappoints us.  We love Indian food and eat it often wherever we go.  Nawabs is good stuff.  They have a mint onion chutney that is second to... Took my wife and my son to this fantastic find 2 weeks ago.  Our server was fantastic and made some excellent recommendations.  We had the Shrimp and grits,...

You'll enjoy it.  Laid back but classy.  Usually quiet on weekdays.  Food is 4/5 Personally I adore this place. Huntington needed a BBQ joint, and if you're picking between Buddy's or Carolina? You're definitely going with Carolina.... One of our favorite places in Huntington!..Try the Spinach and Cheese Puffs, Crab Cakes, Blueberry Wine... it's all fantastic!!..If you can get there when... I'm commenting about the hibachi section of the restaurant. Our party of 14 ranging in age from 3 to 60 had a fantastic time and a great meal. ....Our chef... Inside the bike shop is a sandwich shop. They have the usual fare nothing extra good but nothing bad. If your near by and want to have lunch. It is okay.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047</span></p>
