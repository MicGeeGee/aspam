Non-Prescription Blood Pressure Solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
New Health News for bruce@untroubled.org,

The blood pressure-reducing effect (of these two nutrients) is REAL, scientifically proven in multiple double-blind HUMAN studies.

According to researchers, these nutrients are almost NEVER included in typical blood pressure lowering programs or pills - and very few people know or realize they can have such a positive impact.

Yet they may be the reason why, if you're like most people, nothing has worked for you in the past.

These nutrients are cheaper and yet more effective than many blood pressure-lowering drugs, and have ZERO side effects.
