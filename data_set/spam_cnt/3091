<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">The Advantages of a Career in Accounting</p>

<!-- Paragraph 1 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Variety of Environments - Accountants can choose careers in different industries in the public and private sectors, or they can be self-employed. Accountants may choose to do tax, bookkeeping, payroll or accounting services, while others work in government, finance, insurance, manufacturing or company management. Accountants who have the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) designation often open their own businesses. In addition to the accountants who work in an office, a certain number travel to audit clients, or they work from home.</p>

<!-- Paragraph 2 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Choice of Tasks - Accountants can specialize in different types of work. Public accountants work with balance sheets and tax forms and do external auditing. Management accountants, or cost accountants, prepare reports for the managers of an organization. Government accountants keep the financial records for various levels of government, and internal auditors make sure an organization's funds are properly and efficiently managed.</p>

<!-- Paragraph 3 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Jobs and Income - There were more than one million accountants or auditors working nationwide as of May 2011, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. They reported an average income of $70,120 in 2011, up from an average of $61,690 in 2010. Their 2011 salaries ranged from less than $39,640 for the lowest 10 percent to more than $109,970 for the highest 10 percent. The largest number -- more than 280,000 accountants -- worked for accounting, tax, bookkeeping and payroll services, where they averaged $75,060 per year.</p>
