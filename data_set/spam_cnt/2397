<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">What will it take to earn an accounting degree?</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Earning an accounting degree will require a fair amount of work and expertise, but it's still doable for anyone interested, especially if you're pursuing an accounting degree at the undergraduate level. A bachelor's degree in accounting is offered by a number of different universities and educational institutions throughout the country, and finding a program through which one can secure an accounting degree shouldn't be terribly difficult.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">What do I get from an accounting degree?</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">An accounting degree would enable an individual to function as an accountant in a variety of capacities. These include, but are not limited to, public accounting, management accounting, internal auditing, and governmental auditing. Public accountants would perform many of the traditional accounting tasks, such as auditing, doing taxes, and performing as a consultant, for a variety of potential clients, including corporations and individual citizens. Management accountants are more likely to do work specifically for companies, focused on budgeting, performance evaluations, and other similar inter-company issues. Government accountants perform similar work for government organizations, while auditors might work for organizations such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to perform audits of citizens' taxes.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">An undergraduate accounting degree will often be enough, in terms of accounting education, to facilitate an individual's entrance into the career of accountancy, although this will likely vary from place to place. For example, sometimes, one might be able to obtain a job in accountancy while holding a degree in a related field, as opposed to an out and out accounting degree. In other instances, an individual might only be able to secure a position with an accounting firm if he or she holds a master's degree in accounting, or a master of business administration (MBA) degree with a focus on accounting.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Accounting degrees might not even be necessary for individuals who attend some form of junior college or distance learning course which provides them with the skills they need to obtain junior level clerking or accounting positions, as they could then advance from those positions into higher positions in the field of accountancy. This path might be a good course for someone who does not have the time or the money to pursue a full education in accountancy through more traditional means.</p>
