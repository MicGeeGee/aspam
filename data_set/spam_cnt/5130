    I began itMiss Pross

  Didnt you Who brought her father to life

   Never

     He recovered himself so quicklyhoweverthat Mr Lorry had doubts of his business eye The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more steady than he waswhen he stopped under it to remark to them that he was not yet proof against slight surprises if he ever would beand that the rain had startled him

  Teatimeand Miss Pross making teawith another fit of the jerks upon herand yet no s of people Mr Carton had lounged inbut he made only Two

  The night was so very sultrythat although they sat with doors and dows openthey were overpowered by heat When the teatable was done withthey all moved to one of the dowsand looked out into the heavy twilight Lucie sat by her father Darnay sat beside her Carton leaned against a dow The curtains were long and whiteand some of the thundergusts that whirled into the cornercaught them up to the ceilingand waved them like spectral gs

  The raindrops are still fallinglargeheavyand fewsaid Doctor Manette It comes slowly

  It comes surelysaid Carton

  They spoke lowas people watching and waiting mostly do as people in a dark roomwatching and waiting for Lightningalways do

  There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke the derful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and goingyet not a footstep was there

  A multitude of peopleand yet a solitude said Darnaywhen they had listened for a while

  Is it not impressiveMr Darnay asked Lucie SometimesI have sat here of an eveninguntil I have fanciedbut even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder tonightwhen all is so black and solemn

  Let us shudder too We may know what it is

  It will seem nothing to you Such whims are only impressive as we originate themI think they are not to be communicated I have sometimes sat alone here of an eveninglisteninguntil I have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming byandbye into our lives

  There is a great crowd coming one day into our livesif that be soSydney Carton struck inin his moody way

  The footsteps were incessantand the hurry of them became more and more rapid The corner echoed and reechoed with the tread of feet someas it seemedunder the dows someas it seemedin the room some comingsome goingsome breaking offsome stopping altogether all in the distant streetsand not one within sight

  Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of usMiss Manetteor are we to divide them among us
