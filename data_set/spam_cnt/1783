<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">Dentures or 'false teeth' are designed to replace missing teeth. This equally applies to people who are missing a few teeth as well as those who have lost all of their teeth. They look and behave in the same way as your natural teeth and have proved to be a popular alternative to missing teeth.

Dental technology is advancing all the time and this can be seen in the field of dentures. Modern dentures are made from a variety of materials which includes acrylic resins and the revolutionary flexible denture.
