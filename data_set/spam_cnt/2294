<p style="font-style:normal; text-align:justify; color:#96B8D6"> What did you say

  You can bear a little more light

  I must bear itif you let it in Laying the palest shadow of a stress upon the second word

  The opened halfdoor was opened a little furtherand secured at that angle for the time A broad ray of light fell into the garretand showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lappausing in his labour His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench He had a white beardraggedly cutbut not very longa hollow faceand exceedingly bright eyes The hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look largeunder his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hairthough they had been really otherwise butthey were naturally largeand looked unnaturally so His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throatand showed his body to be withered and worn Heand his old canvas frockand his loose stockingsand all his poor tatters of clotheshadin a long seclusion from direct light and airfaded down to such a dull uniformity of parchmentyellowthat it would have been  to say which was which

  He had put up a hand between his eyes and the lightand the very bones of it seemed transparent So he satwith a steadfastly vacant gazepausing in his work He never looked at the figure before himwithout first looking down on this side of himselfthen on thatas if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound he never spokewithout first wandering in this mannerand forgetting to speak

  Are you going to finish that pair of shoes today asked Defargemotioning to Mr Lorry to come forward
