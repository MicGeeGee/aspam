There are many reasons why you might need to replace your air conditioner. Maybe your unit isn't cooling properly, or maybe it's old and not worth the price of repair. However, not all problems require replacement, and what you thought was a major problem could be the result of a clogged air filter or broken fan.

<br><br><br><br><p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The information below should help you decide if it's time to replace your A/C.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Your A/C is more than 10 years old<br />The average lifespan of an A/C system can range between 15 to 20 years. If your unit is more than 10 years old, consider replacing it with a more efficient unit.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Your A/C needs frequent repairs<br />Consider the condition of your current unit. What is the quality of your equipment? How often does your equipment require maintenance? If you're constantly replacing parts or are having the same repair issues, then you should consider replacement.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">You want to increase your energy savings<br />As of January 26, 2006, a new standard went into effect that requires residential air conditioners to have a Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) of 13 or higher. The higher the SEER rating, the more efficient the product. Efficient A/C systems will lower your utility bills and reduce your environmental impact.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Replacement tips<br />Consider replacing your heating system at the same time you replace your A/C unit, especially if your furnace is more than 15 years old, because connecting an older furnace to an energy-efficient A/C may prevent it from performing at its rated efficiency.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Proper A/C sizing and installation is the key element in deciding efficiency. Too large of a unit will not remove humidity from your home. A unit that's too small will not be able to provide a comfortable temperature on extremely hot days.</p>
