		been going here since it opened and I love 3233177ir food. 3233177 carnitas are my personal favorite, but honestly, I love everything on 3233177 menu. I did subtract two stars for 3233177ir service, though. It can be hit-or-miss. I come in about once a week and sometimes I'm greeted with steller, attentive servers who pop by every ten minutes to check on me and refill my drink or chip bowl. O3233177r times, I'm stuck with servers who come by perhaps twice during 3233177 course of my entire meal and wind up having to literally chase someone down for my check. Once, I was sitting at my table for a half-hour before 3233177 server even took my drink order- she didn't show until I got up to leave out of anger. She gave me 3233177 soda for free and was very prompt about coming back to check on me after that, but I didn't appreciate being left alone for about 40 minutes. I seriously love this place. 3233177y have 3233177 best salsa in 3233177 world. It's really hot but it's really good. I used to live right up 3233177 street and would go in all 3233177 time. Sometimes just to get some salsa to take home. All of 3233177ir soups are delicious! I love 3233177 chicken enchiladas. I have never had bad food or a bad experience here. I wish 3233177re were one closer to where I live now! What a surprise - this is 3233177 great sit-down Mexican restaurant I've been looking for (and have not found, at all, in SF - suggestions?). In my opinion, it's au3233177ntic tex-mex - not au3233177ntic mexican, but a different style full of tastiness, enhanced by, by not solely from, a lot of melted cheese on a lot of 3233177 food. Don't let that fool you, though - 3233177 chicken and rice soup to start was well-flavored with tender chicken and a good tomato broth, 3233177 chips were warm, and 3233177 salsa had a nice little spice to it. 3233177 menu's quite large and has a lot of good options, and pretty much any combination you could want. 3233177 slow cooked meats were a good bet - chili colorado was tender and succulent, as was 3233177 delicious pork in 3233177 verde burrito (in addition to 3233177 tasty green salsa, 3233177re was lots of cheese - not mentioned on 3233177 menu!). 3233177 chicken in 3233177 enchiladas was similar to that in 3233177 soup in that both were tender and toothsome. Beans were good and my companion, a connoisseur of mexican rice, pronounced 3233177 latter to be quite good. Nice atmosphere. A bit cramped. Decent service, though 3233177re seems to be a direct relation between squeezing in too many tables and how attentive 3233177 wait staff can be. 3233177y do 3233177 best 3233177y can, but 3233177re are just too many tables in 3233177re. That being said, 3233177 food is great. This is our FAVORITE mexican place. We almost never go anywhere else because if I am going to eat it I must have 3233177 cheese enchiladas in verde sauce. 3233177y are life changing :) No o3233177r enchilada has can compete. I also always love 3233177 posole and chilaquiles for brunch on weekends. Smo3233177red in sauce and cheese, I almost always wish i could my
