 Of his own desire

   He is greatly changed

  Changed

  TWhy

 he three glided byand went silently down

   Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette

  I show himin the way you have seento a chosen few

  Is that well

  I think it is well

  VI The Shoemaker

Good day said Monsieur Defargelooking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking

  It was raised for a momentand a very faint voice responded to the salutationas if it were at a distance

  Good day

  You are still  at workI see

  After a long silencethe head was lifted for another momentand the voice repliedYesI am working This timea pair of haggard eyes had looked at the questionerbefore the face had dropped again

  The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful It was not the faintness of physical weaknessthough confinement and  fare no doubt had their part in it Its deplorable peculiarity wasthat it was the faintness of solitude and disuse It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago So entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voicethat it affected the senses like a once beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain So sunken and suppressed it wasthat it was like a voice underground So expressive it wasof a hopeless and lost creaturethat a famished travellerwearied out by lonely wandering in a wildernesswould have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die

  Some minutes of silent work had passed and the haggard eyes had looked up again not with any interest or curiositybut with a dull mechanical perceptionbeforehandthat the spot where the only visitor they were aware of had stoodwas not yet empty

  I wantsaid Defargewho had not removed his gaze from the shoemakerto let in a little more light here You can bear a little more

  The shoemaker stopped his work looked with a vacant air of listeningat the floor on one side of him then similarlyat the floor on the other side of him thenupward at the speaker
