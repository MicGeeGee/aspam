Felt like it was in the middle of no where so when we got there I felt like I didn't care what I would eat, but when I saw the menu....EYES POPPING OUT AND... The food was amazing. The counter staff left a lot to be desired. They were obviously not happy to be at work. But great food with huge portions. This place is right on the Mississippi River. We honestly only went here after we found out that the Magnolia Grill had a 45 minute wait but I am so glad we... Really great option in the heart of Natchez. What a beautiful building! As others have said, the house sweet herb vinaigrette is awesome. Wanted more salad... Delic! Had the house charcutes plate with their phenomenal house cured pork sausage.  Super yummy! My SO had their caprese panini, which he really enjoyed.... I think I'm in love.. Skyway has great food with numerous veggie option, attentive staff and a bartender that pours generously. The real appeal (for me)... This was a 5 star spot I was excited to visit after a fun hike at Mirror Lake.  The food really hit the spot with great meals like the expertly cooked filet... Place for locals and snowboarder to come chill, watch a game, have a beer, and check out the menu. The menu is full of delicious items and at a decent... Chips and salsa=Bomb!..Guacamole=Solid!..Chips=Well executed!..Now what the heck else do you need in a good Mexican food spot. We loved this place, especially... Ate here on vacation with family. They had the best chicken fried steak and it was only $4.95. You can't beat that.....The gravy was great along with the service. My mother, brother and I went herr after a nice relaxing time from the hot springs he since the food served at their lounge is ridicously expensive and... If at the Timberline Lodge, the lunch buffet is WELL WORTH the money. The delicious flavors in salads, meats, and desserts were a true highlight of our trip... Sometimes you end up being the customers you never meant to be...The Zig Zag is what it is: The place you stop for a bite between the mountain and Portland....f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
