On a Saturday afternoon when she was thirteen Sabreens mother hit her in the back with a broom handle because a shirt got stolen while the girl was doing their laundry She has grown accustomed to the frequent beatings from her mother and stepfather but this was the last straw for her She asked a cousin of hers to drop her off at her fathers house He told her that when her mother got pregnant she wanted to have an abortion but he convinced her to keep the baby From then on she had resented Sabreen She became a ward of the county Even if it was a bit too much for someone as young as her to bear she was convinced that no foster mother will beat her She was an excellent student far too bright for the previous schools that she attended When her senior year began she was the ninth out of  seniors in terms of GPA She was enrolled in AP and honors classes while juggling  hours of work per week at Bed Bath and Beyond She was finding it difficult to juggle everything but continued to be enthusiastic about school The only person that she talked to about her struggles was Braxton During an October morning her social worker dropped by Braxtons office and asked to speak to her She has been on AWOL for a while and was being asked to pull out of school and be locked in a county facility Braxton made a plea with the social worker because Sabreen has been doing well in school The social worker told him that she needed to return to county foster care immediately 
<br><br>
A few days later Sabreen gets relocated to a new foster home Upon discovering how dirty the bathroom was she decided that it was better to go AWOL again instead of taking a bath in there The next morning she stormed into Braxtons office and cries about how she couldnt handle it all She told him that she wants to rent an apartment instead Braxton kept on encouraging her to tough it out until senior year ends 
<br><br>
The follog Saturday was the Scholastic Aptitude Test Sabreen like the other students at Crenshaw would be walking in the exam room with no preparations Most of the parents of Crenshaw students havent been to college hence their lack of knowledge regarding the importance of SATs Some of the seniors like Olivia have already taken the SATs before Most of the students score  points and above but its still considered to be low Theyre all aiming to score higher to get into good colleges
