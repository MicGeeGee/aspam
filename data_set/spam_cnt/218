With the rise of domestic-terrorism as well as stricter gun laws to contend
with, Americans have been searching for better-ways to protect themselves
and their-families against crime.
<br><br>
The solution? Tactical-flashlights. These have-become such popular self-
defense tools in the wake of recent terror-events that some companies
like <a href="http://lightingnewledspecials.top/ledinfo"><b>TACT9000 Tactical-Flashlight</a></b> can't keep up with demand

The <a href="http://lightingnewledspecials.top/ledinfo"><b>TACT9000 Tactical Flashlight</a></b> is now the most-popular tactical flashlight of choice for most American due to its powerfully disorienting<br>
"strobe mode" that allows the user to flash a blinding strobe-light into the attackers eyes, leaving them "disoriented beyond belief".

		a cubicle to eat. I guess it's good for privacy but 23839235 place just didn't feel very open. It was pretty packed so at least I didn't have to "feel" 23839235 crowd because I was off in 23839235 back but I felt it in terms of service because it took way too long to get my food. I was almost full from chips and ready to leave by 23839235 time my food came. If I'm passing through downtown I'll probably check this place out again and order something different. I'll update my review at that time but for now I'll say it's "Okay". If anyone that has eaten here can tell me what to try that gets this place such great reviews I'll gladly try it. I'm always looking for good places to eat and I thought this would be one of those spots, so far I'm not 23839235re yet. Me and my friend decides to check out this place. Friday night, this place is packed with ppl and busy. Server got us a table outside in 5 minutes. While waiting we enjoyed chips and salsa. 23839235ir salsa is spicy & deelish! We both ordered 23839235 Dos Tacos dish which came with 2 soft shell tacos, rice, beans, and a side of salad/soup. I noticed that almost all 23839235 items on 23839235ir menu ranged $12.99 and up. 23839235y also have margaritas Both of our dishes arrived at 23839235 same time so that was a plus. Tacos are loaded with flavor with our choice of steak! Sooo good! I luvv flavor. Servers were very attentive; that is also plus. 23839235y have vegetarian for you non-meat lovers! My only con are 23839235 flies that buzzz'd around 23839235 food since we were outside. I would definitely come back to try more, just dine inside instead. Been here a couple times and had a different experience each time.  My first here was last year during 23839235 summer.  We grabbed an outside table on 23839235 patio for dinner and some beers.  Grubbed on some yummy tacos, rice & beans 23839235n downed a couple typical Mexican beers.  Overall a pretty pleasant experience.  Also have been here for lunch for 23839235 taco salad which was alright & 23839235n ano23839235r time to have 23839235 chicken fajitas.  23839235 fajitas were BOMB.  23839235 chicken comes out sizzling on a skillet with grilled veggies and tortillas on 23839235 side.  Will definitely be ordering 23839235se again.  Service at 23839235 tables was alright.. 23839235 waitresses could have been a bit more attentive, but hey whatever my tummy was happy Just returned back here last Sunday for some drinks.  Was planning on being responsible and just having a beer (Isn't that always how it goes..) Instead 23839235 bartender suckered us into having a "Mexican mind eraser".  WOW one of 23839235se and you are more than good to go.  It was a strong concoction of mescal, flavored liqueur, and root beer?  Had to guzzle in all down at once with a single straw and couldn't stop till you drank of it.  Was feeling very good and decided to get a margarita to top it off and 23839235n ended with a shot of tequila. Chatted it up with 23839235 super friendly bartender.. Almost felt like you were in some quaint little bar in Central America.  A super fun Sunday Funday.. Highly recommend sitting at 23839235 bar if you feel like some good drinks and chatting it up this summer!!  If you can
