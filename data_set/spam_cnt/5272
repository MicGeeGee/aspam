  Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage which might have been lighterconducted by four posthorses and two postilionsged up a steep hill A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was no impeachment of his high breeding it was not from within it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his controlthe setting sun

  The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hilltopthat its occupant was steeped in crimson It will die outsaid Monsieur the Marquisglancing at his handsdirectly

  In effectthe sun was so low that it dipped at the moment When the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheeland the carriage slid down hillwith a cinderous smellin a cloud of dustthe red glow departed quickly the sun and the Marquis going down togetherthere was no glow left when the drag was taken off

  The village had its one poor streetwith its poor brewerypoor tannerypoor tavernpoor stableyard for relays of posthorsespoor fountainall usual poor appointments It had its poor people too All its people were poorand many of them were sitting at their doorsshredding spare onions and the like for supperwhile many were at the fountainwashing leavesand grassesand any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten Expressive signs of what made them poorwere not wanting the tax for the statethe tax for the churchthe tax for the lordtax local and tax generalwere to be paid here and to be paid thereaccording to solemn inscription in the little villageuntil the der wasthat there was any village left unswallowed

  Few ren were to be seenand no dogs As to the men and womentheir choice on earth was stated in the prospectLife on the lowest terms that could sustain itdown in the little village under the mill or captivity and  in the dominant prison on the crag
