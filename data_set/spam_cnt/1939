Older, traditional phone systems were quite expensive, and they were difficult to reconfigure or scale up or down as business demands. However, Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, offers phone technology using internet connections, and hosted VoIP systems in particular offers many benefits over the old systems.

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">1. VoIP Is Easier to Install, Configure, and Maintain</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">IP Phones are simple to install, even for people with limited technical know-how. Rather than having someone come and run phone wiring through your facility, you can set up an IP Phone and be ready to go quickly. Hosted VoIP software makes it easy and inexpensive to add new users, and a convenient web portal makes it easy to move, add, or change the system's configuration. There is no VoIP hardware to install, you only need IP phones, and you don't even have to install software.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">2. VoIP Scales Up or Down Easily</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">It's not always easy to predict how many phones you'll need over the next year, and if you have a traditional phone system, you have to estimate carefully to avoid spending money on phone lines you won't use. All this goes away with Hosted Telephone systems. With VoIP for your business, you can add a line as soon as you add a new employee, and when an employee leaves, you can easily reassign or remove the line. You always have the right number of phone lines for your needs.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">3. Employees' Numbers Follow Them Wherever They Go</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Are you rearranging or expanding your office space? Hosted VoIP phone systems let users access a convenient web portal to reconfigure the system at any time. Hosted VoIP phone systems are also terrific for businesses that have field workers or workers who travel a lot. Calls can be diverted to anywhere in the world due to cloud-hosted VoIP phone system features.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">4. A Range of Call Features Is Supported</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">All of the traditional call system features you expect are available in hosted VoIP systems, including call hold, call transfer, call hunt, conference calling, find me / follow me, and auto-attendant phone menus. You won't give up any of your favorite features by choosing hosted VoIP.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">5. Even Older Technology Like Fax Is Supported</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Virtual faxing (also called IP faxing) is another feature of VoIP phone systems. Even in the age of email and instant communication, there are some instances when faxes are necessary. Without the need for paper or toner, you can send and receive faxes using the email account you already have with a hosted VoIP system.</p>
