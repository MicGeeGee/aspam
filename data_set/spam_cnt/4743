<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Demand For Medical CodersMedical Coder<br /> <br />There is a growing need for medical coders and now is a good time to join this industry if you're looking for a strong job market. With the impending switch from ICD-9 to ICD-10, we will soon see the demand for skilled medical coders with ICD-10 certification and training increase. The switch will take effect October 1st, 2015 and at that point, unless the state has been issued and extension, it will be required that all medical coding be done in ICD-10. This change will leave many healthcare and insurance providers unequipped to continue providing service at same capacity. In preparation for this switch many medical coding companies and healthcare service providers are seeking out coders with ICD-10 certification.<br /> <br />Work Remotely<br /> <br />Although medical coders work in settings ranging from doctor's offices to insurance agencies, many coders enjoy the benefit of working from home. This is appealing for those looking for a flexible work schedule or for those who live in a remote location. Other benefits include; elimination of stressful commutes, decrease on gas spend and increase of personal time. For parents, working remotely provides an alternative to daycare and also allows more one-on-one time with the kids.<br /> <br />Potential For Growth And Promotion<br /> <br />Medical coding requires attention to detail, organization and strong critical thinking skills. These requirements are not for everyone and will eliminate those who are not cut out for the demands of this job. However, those who are prepared to handle these challenges will thrive in this position. Leaders in healthcare are aware of the importance for skilled medical coders and the vital role they play in the industry and will reward those who demonstrate these crucial skills. <br /> <br />Become Part Of One Of The Largest And Fastest Growing Industries<br /> <br />From an economic perspective, healthcare has been and continues to be one of the most stable and profitable industries in our nation. For those looking for a job with potential long-term investment, this industry is a smart choice. While many companies falter with fluctuations in the stock market and other economic variables, healthcare providers are always in demand. With the passage of Obamacare we have recently seen a boom in health insurance enrollment, resulting in an even greater demand of medical services. (Wegerer, 2015) This increase has also led to further need for medical coders to meet the needs of this increase.</p>
