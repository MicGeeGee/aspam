Roy's is officially a must stop for us. We are out-of-towners but have made three stops at Roy's in the last 6 weeks...Stop #1 was at the end of a long hot... What a great find!..My wife and I came here at the end of a long work day. We showed up just before closing time, which obviously isn't ideal. Chef Alfredo... Love the food!....It can take some time when you are inside. So I always call my order in and pick up. Best Camarone Diablo ever. In fact this place is excellent! Please go have lunch or dinner there. You will not be disappointed.....Love this place. The prices... Wife and I had burgers. Both were awesome.  Very friendly staff...Tv in dining room with sports on and low volume music from the bar Very impressed, would return..We had the breaded mushrooms appetizer. They are fresh mushrooms not frozen. Crunchy and delicious. We then had grilled chicken.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

They accept cash and credit. Super friendly people and there... Steak wrap is delicious along with the nacho's! Everything is made fresh! The staff are friendly \u0026 the beer is always cold! We go to Le Cafe a handful times a year.  Never have a problem with the service except they need to hire more waitresses.  They are always busy.  The food... Amazing food in Northern WI!  You will not be disappointed with anything that comes out of the kitchen prepared by Chef Chuck.  4 of us dined after 18 holes... We were seeking the classic WI supper club experience and took a chance on the Chippewa Inn based on other reviews.  Interestingly, none of the reviews... The food here is outstanding. We had a table of seven and tried the baked fish, fried fish, and fried chicken. All three were delicious and cooked... Delicious! This is my favorite place to eat in Hayward! Great relish tray and drinks to start. Gluten free options aplenty. Great steaks and seafood... I have to tell you...looks can be deceiving...what appears to be \"just a bar\" is more than that once you get inside.....We were up in Hayward on our yearly... This is a fun, typical Wisconsin Supper Club.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive.  The food was made perfect!  I had the walnut bleu steak, medium... I was on a fishing trip, stayed in Hayward, and decided to eat at this restaurant.  This is a very unorthodox restaurant because it is actually a restaurant... I've been coming here for several years and the food and service is always awesome.  And the owner is really cool! My favorite place for breakfast in the state!  Always seems to have a good lunch special.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
