/---->One evening while Fahrquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench near the entrance to his grounds a grayclad soldier rode up to the gate and asked for a drink of water Mrs Fahrquhar was only too happy to serve him with her own white hands While she was fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from the front

/---->The Yanks are repairing the railroads said the man and are getting ready for another advance They have reached the Owl Creek bridge put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank The commandant has issued an order which is posted everywhere declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad its bridges tunnels or trains will be summarily hanged I saw the orderHow far is it to the Owl Creek bridge Fahrquhar asked

/---->All that day he traveled laying his course by the rounding sun The forest seemed interminable nowhere did he discover a break in it not even a woodmans road He had not known that he lived in so wild a region There was something uncanny in the revelation

/---->By nightfall he was fatigued footsore famished The thought of his wife and ren urged him on At last he found a road which led him in what he knew to be the right direction It was as wide and straight as a city street yet it seemed untraveled No fields bordered it no dwelling anywhere Not so much as the barking of a dog suggested human habitation The black bodies of the trees formed a straight wall on both sides terminating on the horizon in a point like a diagram in a lesson in perspective Overhead as he looked up through this rift in the wood shone great golden stars looking unfamiliar and grouped in strange constellations He was sure they were arranged in some order which had a secret and malign significance The wood on either side was full of singular noises among which  once twice and again  he distinctly heard whispers in an unknown tongue

/---->His neck was in pain and lifting his hand to it found it horribly swollen He knew that it had a circle of black where the rope had bruised it His eyes felt congested he could no longer close them His tongue was swollen with thirst he relieved its fever by thrusting it forward from between his teeth into the cold air How softly the turf had carpeted the untraveled avenue  he could no longer feel the roadway beneath his feet

Doubtless despite his suffering he had fallen asleep while walking for now he sees another scene  perhaps he has merely recovered from a delirium He stands at the gate of his own home All is as he left it and all bright and beautiful in the morning sunshine He must have traveled the entire night As he pushes open the gate and pes up the wide white walk he sees a flutter of female garments 

/---->his wife looking fresh and cool and sweet steps down from the veranda to meet him At the bottom of the steps she stands waiting with a smile of ineffable joy an attitude of matchless grace and dignity Ah how beautiful she is He springs forwards with extended arms As he is about to clasp her he feels a stunning blow upon the back of the neck a blinding white light blazes all about him with a sound like the shock of a cannon  then all is darkness and silence
