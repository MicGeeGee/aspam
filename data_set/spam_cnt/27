I worked in Latrobe in the late 90's and was first introduced to Jioio's then.  I had never eaten a 'sweet' pizza, and I've yet to find one that I like... The calamari was some of the best I've had.  The service was amazing.  Definitely a must try... To this date for over 5 years I never had a bad meal.  Salads are loaded with nice ingredients and their pizza is great.  Then their brgrs are tasty and... Greensburg may be small, but its restaurant game is strong.  One Eleven is absolutely lovely-- we've had two great experiences here.....Our first visit was...

Coctel de Camaron plenty of shrimp...super sensitive! All around hospitality is amazing!! During a trip to Bakersfield I decided to eat at a highly rated restaurant about an hour north of my hotel, The Dutch Frontier.....Arrived 25 minutes early,... Always order war won ton soup and it's always great family likes to order orange chicken chow mein and rice our go to when we don't want to cook dinner This is the second sushi place I have tried in Delano.  it is located on Main St. in between 10th and 11th St.  It is usually hard to find parking around...f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
