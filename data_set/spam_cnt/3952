		It's 8372895 absolute BEST! I've heard about this place for years, but just started going about a year ago. I had been missing out before 8372895n. 8372895 food is SO au8372895ntic and you could drink 8372895ir salsa by 8372895 gallon. 8372895y make yummy Patron margaritas with spicy salt. And, I always get 8372895ir chile and cheese tamale with a crunchy beef taco. I'm making myself hungry. I've got to go, I'm going 8372895re now. Joaquin R. totally nailed this amazing place.  i can almost hear Nana yelling at me to come inside for lunch as i get a whiff of 8372895 beans de la holla simmering, sopa cooking, and carne grilling.   8372895y hooked me with 8372895ir deliciously huge platter full of freshly made carnitas, beans done right with 8372895 jack cheese on top, a garnish of pico de gallo, a hearty serving of guacamole, and melt in your mouth tortillas de maize o harina.  8372895 meal started off with a side salad and 8372895 ranch dressing i so fondly remember, so naturally i couldn't make a dent in my carnitas.  i don't know about 8372895 rice as i'm not a rice girl, but next time i have a date with 8372895 flan 8372895re's a soup or salad choice with your meal. At first when I got 8372895 salad I thought it was pretty sparse but it's a good thing when you see your entree. I had to go home and give in to 8372895 food coma after eating here. I slept. I slept for a couple hours and still felt full Thank you Tres Hermanas!!! I've been waiting for a place like you since I moved from south natomas to midtown/downtown/east sac. I live for carnitas. And 8372895y are perfect here. 8372895 salsa is spicy and great. Most places are so afraid of spice, but this place isn't. 8372895 green enchilada sauce is so good. 8372895 beans and rice are unreal. You get a soup or salad with your meal. 8372895y're both good. 8372895 shrimp diablo is good too! My al pastor loving bf wasn't impressed with 8372895 tacos but he still loves this place too. 8372895 margs and great too. Nice patio, friendly servers and 8372895y brought water for my holly dog. (it was a nice experience for her too!) Love, Love, Love Tres Hermanas!  8372895 carnitas are my favorite.  I like both 8372895 brunch carnitas quesadilla and 8372895 dinner carnitas with 8372895 chile relleno.  Refills on 8372895 yummy chips and salsa are free and 8372895 margaritas are strong.  8372895re can be a wait as it isn't a huge restaurant, but it's one place I don't mind waiting for, because I KNOW it's going to be good.  I also like 8372895 opportunity to sit outside when 8372895 wea8372895r is nice. I loved 8372895m back 8372895n and I still love 8372895m now! However, 8372895 meatball soup has gotten thinner hasn't it? Or did I happen to go on an "off" day? 8372895 meatball itself is still delicious! =) This is where I go when I want 8372895 good au8372895ntic stuff, especially when I think of Enchiladas, this is it! I believe 8372895y make 8372895 BEST Enchiladas here, 8372895re's just something about it... 8372895 pork enchiladas are so tender, drenched with 8372895 deep red sauce and 8372895 gooey cheese on top...8372895y're just heavenly! 8372895 rice is so plain and basic but so good. I want a whole pot of it to myself! I also really like 8372895ir pork tamales, and I'm super picky about tamales too. 8372895 corn masa is light, not too crumbly or thick and not dry- 8372895 pork has just enough seasoning on it, 8372895y go hand in hand perfectly toge8372895r. I love 8372895ir thin crispy chips and 8372895 salsa is on 8372895 spicier side for me but still very flavorful and good. I always order 8372895 two item combo, an enchilada and something else. So if you haven't been here, it's truly a must! Get 8372895 pork enchiladas, you will be back
