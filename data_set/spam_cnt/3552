<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Benefit 1: Stable Environment<br />The first benefit of a treatment centre for a drug or alcohol addiction has to be the stable environment it has to offer. This is especially crucial for a newly recovering addict of drugs or alcohol. A stable environment will be able to keep any drug or alcohol addict away from any kind of temptations, while being in a safe and secure environment.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Benefit 2: Counsellors<br />Counsellors that know about addiction are the best ones to help any addict get past their addiction and on to a better life. Having the right counselors can be the best benefit any treatment center can offer their patients.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Benefit 3: Learning<br />Learning about addiction, how to overcome it, relapse prevention, and more is another benefit that helps patients to realise there is a way to live a life without drugs or alcohol. Learning the proper tools and how to use them is key to any addict trying to recover.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Benefit 4: Peer Support<br />Treatment centers for drug or alcohol addiction are all people trying to do the same thing; get help for their addiction. This means that by going, a drug or alcohol addict is surrounded by people going through the same things. This will give the patient the much needed peer support that is known to help during this stage of recovery, and at the same time they are able to give and take advice.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Benefit 5: A Daily Routine<br />Drug and alcohol treatment centers make their patients participate in a daily routine. The patient will go to group therapy, one on one therapy, alternative therapy, and 12 step support groups at a given time. A good treatment center will even teach recovering addicts about good nutrition and have patients be involved in regular fitness daily.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Benefit 6: Zero Tolerance<br />A zero tolerance policy means that no one is allowed to bring drugs or alcohol into the treatment center. Most rehab treatment centers will ask the person to leave if they are caught with drugs or alcohol. No one needs to be tempted while in getting treatment; this is why rehabs enforce this policy so strictly.</p>
