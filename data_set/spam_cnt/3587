		plate. 7908284 salsa and chips are fresh and spicy. You won't be able to eat chevy's salsa again after this. 7908284 spanish rice taste like 7908284y fry it and it is delicious. This is 7908284 only place I eat 7908284 spanish rice! I just took away 1 point for consistency. Over 7908284 last year 7908284re have been a few visits where 7908284 food wasn't prepared as well as normal. Still is good and I wouldn't stop going 7908284re, but disappointing when you know how incredible it can be. We had 7908284ir chile relleno, carnitas tacos and pork tamale to-go.  7908284 tamale was 7908284 best out of 7908284 three with melt-in-your-mouth corn and tender marinated pork, 7908284 red sauce had a good kick as well.  7908284 chile relleno was a standard good, not great, 7908284 pepper felt slightly undercooked so it was a bit stringier than what I'm used to.  7908284 tacos were great but 7908284 carnitas felt a little dry. I'm not keen on Mexican food but if I'm going to eat it, Tres Hermanas is 7908284 place to go for a full-service experience. This place feels homey, healthy and servers on a weekday were very pleasant. Bottomless, fresh chips and spicy salsa (a little too hot for me, 7908284 New England bland girl) but big glasses of water and cans of soda make it cool down. 7908284 carne asada (sliced steak to me) is absolutely amazing, generously portioned and delicious with lots of cilantro and onions. It feels like REAL food, not hidden smushy stuff I get at Ernestos. I had whole beans (instead of refried) and 7908284y were deliciously seasoned.  7908284 rice is great too. For lunch, I find it a little pricey - $8 for a single corn taco or $9 burrito , both w/ rice and beans. But boy is it delicious and comes with a garden salad (or soup which I've never had). Order 7908284 creamy cilantro dressing -  it's great on 7908284 salad, dipping for chips, etc etc.  I've never had a favorite Mexican restaurant  before, but now I do. Everything I've tried has been delicious. I discovered this place working 7908284re as a contractor. Not only is 7908284 food wonderful, but I was impressed with how clean 7908284 kitchen, bathrooms and rest of 7908284 establishment is and how great 7908284 staff is to work with.  After watching and smelling 7908284 food being prepared for several days I had to eat here and was very impressed. 7908284 creamy cilantro dressing is a favorite. Also ordered 7908284 Ensalada Norte??a salad with carnitas on top. 7908284 pork is crispy on 7908284 outside and tender and juicy on 7908284 inside, and seasoned just right. 7908284 meatball soup is real 'comfort food' at its best. 7908284 chips, salsa, beans, rice, everything else is fresh and delicious.  Also 7908284 decor is fun. Boys who love reptiles should check out 7908284 huge snake in 7908284 men's room. Our family has been going to Tres for almost 20 years! 7908284y have 7908284 best carnitas, chili verde, creamy cilantro dressing, chips and salsa.  We are never disappointed and always enjoy our meals.  We have taken out of town family and friends 7908284re too I really like this Mexican restaurant. It's a very good place to eat. 7908284 food is fresh tasting. Whe7908284r 7908284 place is busy, or
