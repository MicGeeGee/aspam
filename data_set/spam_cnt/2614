The world needs its accountants
As long as money makes it go round, the world will need its accountants. Sure, accountants and finance professionals have to move with the times and stay up-to-date, but the profession is unlikely to expire anytime soon.

<p><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium; color: #339966;">Accounting is one of the most illustrious careers you can go into.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">If you're looking for long term job security, earning an accounting degree is a good idea.</span></p>

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">You could work in any industry:<br />Accountants record, classify, summarise, interpret and communicate the financial information about a business. You can apply this to any company, in any field, industry, sector - you name it. Better still, you could be working across a number of industries.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Internationally diverse cohort:<br />Subjects which fall under the broad spectrum of Business and Administrative Studies, including Accounting & Finance, benefit from the most culturally diverse student cohort of all. Over 55,000 of the UK's students in this area come from overseas. A diverse cohort will not only expose you to people of different cultures but can provide you with an international network of contacts who could prove influential later in life.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Joint honours:<br />Accounting & Finance complements other subject areas very well, particularly those which fall under the large umbrella of business. A number of universities offer courses to reflect this fact. Study for a joint honours degree to become a broad business person, an accountant with a second language (particularly useful in a global marketplace), or simply combine with another passion of yours.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Real-life application:<br />Accounting & Finance degrees often take a highly practical approach, meaning universities ensure their students learn by doing. Students benefit from simulated and real-life opportunities to manage business accounts. Many Accounting & Finance courses have an optional placement year, and with a year in industry under your belt you'll surely leave prepared for the rigours of professional life.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Year abroad opportunities:<br />Business is a global enterprise these days, and it would be silly for Accounting & Finance education providers to not reflect this fact. Hence why so many do. A year abroad will provide students with a deep understanding of the global economy, experience of other cultures, and language skills.</p>
