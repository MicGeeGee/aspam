		complaint o21683810r 21683810n being too stuffed! Tres Hermanas is a quaint restaurant tucked away on K street in what looks like a Victorian house turned restaurant.  21683810 place is always busy and 21683810 food is consistently good.  21683810 meatball soup is awesome and 21683810 cilantro dressing is amazing if you opt for 21683810 salad.  Make sure to get 21683810 Margaritas; 21683810y are good and strong, plus you can get 21683810m by 21683810 pitcher!   To 21683810 woman who said yesterday that this place is au21683810ntic and people are used to fast food etc: It is not au21683810ntic. I'm of Hispanic decent, married to a Mexican man, been to Mexico, will be back in Mexico in February, raised in a mostly Mexican town.Taught by Mexicans with 4th generation techniques and recipes.  I eat mostly Mexican food on a daily basis. Just because 21683810 owners are Mexican, doesn't mean that 21683810 food is au21683810ntic. That is such a common misconception. Trust me, just because someone looks like an au21683810ntic Mexican, doesn't mean 21683810 food is. Most taquerias take short cuts as well. If you want 21683810 real shit, go to a food truck. Street food COOKED by a viejita who busts out tortas, elotes, etc like nobody's business. THAT is au21683810ntic. but you seem like 21683810 kind of woman who would bitch and moan about how you'll get food poisoning. You're more likely to get food poisoning from a big ass restaurant who is understaffed than a little food truck. So go back to Chevy's for your au21683810ntic nachos, which btw, aren't Mexican.  Nachos were created for white people who can't handle real au21683810ntic food.  Tourist food.  amount of people who should be covering each place of 21683810 restaurant. 21683810 dishwasher should not have to come out to fill your drinks. That means, 21683810y're slammed and understaffed. I've been 21683810 dishwasher who had to come out and serve drinks. I've eaten here about 4 times. It seems like each time I don't like it as much. Food comes out ridiculously hot, and my beans were chilly in 21683810 center. Nuked much? Service is wacky, but I know it's because 21683810y're so under staffed. 21683810y do forget about you, but I'll give 21683810m 21683810 benefit of 21683810 doubt that if 21683810y were properly staffed, 21683810y would be on point. I hope  I heard about how amazing this food is. It isn't bad, but... growing up with Mexican influence and culture in a mostly Hispanic town, I can tell you this is not au21683810ntic, and a lot of it is semi homemade. For 21683810 prices 21683810y charge, I'm not cool with that. It's way over priced for what you get. You get huge portions of over cooked rice and beans all topped with mozarella, which isn't Mexican last time I checked! We asked one of 21683810 owners if 21683810y had o21683810r cheeses. My hubby, who is Mexican as
