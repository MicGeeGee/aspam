Okay so I was hovering between 3 and four stars on this one.  We went there last week and I ordered the seafood chimichanga,   I didn't even make it out of... Definitely a great place to eat. Very good food, really great service... And sweet tea! I've enjoyed eating here often while in town for work. Pretty good Mexican with convenient location for Rockwood and Gibraltar residents.....I would recommend the fajitas. The dining area is very small, so To Go...
