<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Why Go To Graduate School</p>

<!-- Paragraph 1 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Invest in your future. Although it's not strictly necessary to have a firm view of your future career before applying to graduate school, it certainly helps. This is because grad school often acts as the academic version of professional training, enabling students to graduate with all the right knowledge in all the right places, ready to jump straight into their desired careers.</p>

<!-- Paragraph 2 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Get noticed in today's job market. More people than ever are attending graduate school today, and because of this an undergraduate degree alone can sometimes fail to get you noticed alongside equally or more highly qualified candidates. With university education in contemporary society increasingly viewed as more of a rite of passage than a luxury, and 11% of the workforce now holding a graduate degree, bachelor degree holders are struggling to appeal to employers even at entry level in certain industries ??? especially when up against candidates with PhDs.</p>

<!-- Paragraph 3 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Pursue your interests in more depth. Although most undergraduate degrees allow students the opportunity to study modules and classes of personal interest, a graduate degree does this to a much greater extent. In order to get the most out of your graduate degree, you will be expected to conduct personal research alongside set study topics, in order to develop your thoughts and ideas regarding something that deeply interests you..</p>

<!-- Paragraph 4 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Bettered financial prospects is a popular answer to the question "Why go to graduate school?" ??? though it may not necessarily be the most important factor. Even so, a graduate degree has been found to improve the financial prospects of workers by over US$8,200 more each year, compared to someone holding just a bachelor's degree. Although this may not seem like a life-changing amount, the additional money accumulated in a working lifetime works out at around US$328,700. And that's just the extra!</p>
