		I have been going to Tres for over six years and I just love everything about this place. 8198874 staff is always polite. While 8198874y do get busy 8198874 wait time is never ridiculously long and you know what -- I don't mind waiting. 8198874 decor is fun and interesting. I highly recommend 8198874ir taco des res which is 8198874ir crispy taco with shredded beef piled high with lettuce and cheese is my favorite. 8198874ir cheese enchilada with green sauce is spicy and always hits 8198874 spot. Recently I ventured away from 8198874 norm and ordered 8198874ir shredded beef enchilada with mole sauce which was dark and rich in flavor. When I want a meal I always order 8198874ir milanesa entree of thin slices of steak heavily seasoned and breaded and 8198874n pan fried. It is a little bit salty and a perfect size for sharing.  Absolutely love this place! 8198874ir mole is delicious! 8198874 wait can be really long at times but worth it. 8198874 reason i gave four stars is because a few times I've been 8198874ir I've had very bad service. But o8198874r times  everything is perfect! Probably one of 8198874 best mexican restaurants in Sacramento.  It's a little on 8198874 pricey side, but 8198874 tacos are delicious.  Service has always been great and 8198874 margaritas are strong. It was a lazy Sunday afternoon.  And hot.  I didn't want to cook anything, and I didn't want to reheat 8198874 leftovers I'd eaten yesterday.  What I really wanted was some gooey Mexican food smo8198874red in red sauce, cheese, and especially guacamole. I checked 8198874 to find Mexican food near my apartment, and I settled on Jalapeno's.  Closed!  8198874n I meandered to Mezkal.  Also closed "I demand satisfaction!" I challenged 8198874 statue of a Mexican man behind 8198874 closed glass door of Mezkal.  And 8198874n I asked a real man standing nearby and staring where I could find o8198874r Mexican food, and he directed me to Tres Hermanas. Tres Hermanas was pretty full, and since 8198874 wea8198874r had cooled down I asked to be seated outside.  Which was a poor choice, because as I write this - after I returned home - I find that I am covered in bug bites.  I wonder how many stars I would receive.8198874 problem with dining alone in a crowded restaurant is that it always takes a long time to get served, and you don't have anything o8198874r than 8198874 book you brought to distract you from how hungry you are.  Sometimes I suspect that waitresses consider a lone female a nuisance, and serve her as an afterthought. So by 8198874 time I finally received my chips, water, and salad - I received nothing until a good 15 minutes after I sat down - I was famished.  By 8198874 time I actually received my entree, 10 minutes later, I had scarfed down nearly 8198874 entire large plate of chips - disgusting, especially considering that 8198874 chips taste like what you would buy at one of 8198874 convenience stores near my home.
