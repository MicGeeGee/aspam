   <p>5 WORST Things That Happen While Having A Stroke<br /> I went home fe=
eling quite sad, and almost reproaching myself for not having taken compass=
ion on then; however, just as I was sitting down to supper they appeared be=
fore me like four Magdalens. The eldest, who was the orator of the company,=
 told me that their mother was in prison, and that they would have to pass =
the night in the street if I did not take pity on them. &quot; You shall ha=
ve rooms, beds, and good fires,&quot; said I, &quot; but first let me see y=
ou eat.&quot; Delight appeared on every countenance, and I had numerous dis=
hes brought for them. They ate eagerly but sadly, and only drank water. &qu=
ot; Your melancholy and your abstinence displeases me,&quot; said I, to the=
 eldest girl; &quot; go upstairs and you will find everything necessary for=
 your comfort, but take care to be gone at seven in the morning and not to =
let me see your faces again.&quot; They went up to the second floor without=
 a word. An hour afterwards, just as I was going to bed, the eldest girl ca=
me into my room and said she wished to have a private interview with me. I =
told my negro to withdraw, and asked her to explain herself. &quot; What wi=
ll you do for us,&quot; said she, &quot; if I consent to share your couch?&=
quot; &quot; I will give you twenty guineas, and I will lodge and board you=
 as long as you give me satisfaction.&quot; Without saying a word she began=
 to undress, and got into bed. She was submissive and nothing more, and did=
 not give me so much as a kiss. At the end of a quarter of an hour I was di=
sgusted with her and got up, and giving her a bank note for twenty guineas =
I told her to put on her clothes and go back to her room. &quot; You must a=
ll leave my house to-morrow,&quot; I said, &quot; for I am ill pleased with=
 you. Instead of giving yourself up for love you have prostituted yourself.=
 I blush for you.&quot; She obeyed mutely, and I went to sleep in an ill hu=
mour. At about seven o' clock in the morning I was awakened by a hand shaki=
ng me gently. I opened my eyes, and I was surprised to see the second daugh=
ter. &quot; What do you want?&quot; I said, coldly. &quot; I want you to ta=
ke pity on us, and shelter us in your house for a few days longer. I will b=
e very grateful. My sister has told me all, you are displeased with her, bu=
t you must forgive her, for her heart is not her own. She is in love with a=
n Italian who is in prison for debt.&quot; &quot; And I suppose you are in =
love with someone else?&quot; &quot; No, I am not.&quot; &quot; Could you l=
ove me?&quot; She lowered her eyes, and pressed my hand gently. I drew her =
towards me, and embraced her, and as I felt her kisses answer mine, I said,=
-- &quot; You have conquered.&quot; &quot; My name is Victoire.&quot; &quot=
; I like it, and I will prove the omen a true one.&quot; Victoire, who was =
tender and passionate, made me spend two delicious hours, which compensated=
 me for my bad quarter of an hour of the night before. When our exploits we=
re over, I said,-- &quot; Dearest Victoire, I am wholly throe. Let your mot=
her be brought here as soon as she is free. Here are twenty guineas for you=
&quot; She did not expect anything, and the agreeable surprise made her in=
 an ecstasy; she could not speak, but her heart was full of happiness. I to=
o was happy, and I believed that a great part of my happiness was caused by=
 the knowledge that I had done a good deed. We are queer creatures all of u=
s, whether we are bad or good. From that moment I gave my servants orders t=
o lay the table for eight persons every day, and told them that I was only =
at home to Goudar. I spent money madly, and felt that I was within a measur=
able distance of poverty. At noon the mother came in a sedan-chair, and wen=
t to bed directly. I went to see her, and did not evince any surprise when =
she began to thank me for my noble generosity. She wanted me to suppose tha=
t she thought I had given her daughters forty guineas for nothing, and I le=
t her enjoy her hypocrisy. In the evening I took them to Covent Garden, whe=
re the castrato Tenducci surprised me by introducing me to his wife, of who=
m he had two children. He laughed at people who said that a castrato could =
not procreate. Nature had made him a monster that he might remain a man; he=
 was born triorchis, and as only two of the seminal glands had been destroy=
ed the remaining one was sufficient to endow him with virility. When I got =
back to my small seraglio I supped merrily with the five nymphs, and spent =
a delicious night with Victoire, who was overjoyed at having made my conque=
st. She told me that her sister' s lover was a Neapolitan, calling himself =
Marquis de Petina, and that they were to get married as soon as he was out =
of prison. It seemed he was expecting remittances, and the mother would be =
delighted to see her daughter a marchioness. &quot; How much does the marqu=
is owe?&quot; &quot; Twenty guineas.&quot; &quot; And the Neapolitan ambass=
ador allows him to languish in prison for such a beggarly sum? I can' t bel=
ieve it.&quot; &quot; The ambassador won' t have anything to do with him, b=
ecause he left Naples without the leave of the Government.&quot; &quot; Tel=
l your sister that if the ambassador assures me that her lover' s name is r=
eally the Marquis de Petina, I will get him out of prison immediately.&quot=
; I went out to ask my daughter, and another boarder of whom I was very fon=
d, to dinner, and on my way called on the Marquis of Caraccioli, an agreeab=
le man, whose acquaintance I had made at Turin. I found the famous Chevalie=
r d' Eon at his house, and I had no need of a private interview to make my =
inquiries about Petina. &quot; The young man is really what he professes to=
 me,&quot; said the ambassador, &quot; but I will neither receive him nor g=
ive him any money till I hear from my Government that he has received leave=
 to travel.&quot; That was enough for me, and I stayed there for an hour li=
stening to d' Eon' s amusing story. Eon had deserted the embassy on account=
 of ten thousand francs which the department of foreign affairs at Versaill=
es had refused to allow him, though the money was his by right. He had plac=
ed himself under the protection of the English laws, and after securing two=
 thousand subscribers at a guinea apiece, he had sent to press a huge volum=
e in quarto containing all the letters he had received from the French Gove=
rnment for the last five or six years. About the same time a London banker =
had deposited the sum of twenty thousand guineas at the Bank of England, be=
ing ready to wager that sum that Eon was a woman. The bet was taken by a nu=
mber of persons who had formed themselves into a kind of company for the pu=
rpose, and the only way to decide it was that Eon should be examined in the=
 presence of witnesses. The chevalier was offered half the wager, but he la=
ughed them to scorn. He said that such an examination would dishonour him, =
were he man or woman. Caraccioli said that it could only dishonour him if h=
e were a woman, but I could not agree with this opinion. At the end of a ye=
ar the bet was declared off; but in the course of three years he received h=
is pardon from the king, and appeared at Court in woman' s dress, wearing t=
he cross of St. Louis. Louis XV. had always been aware of the chevalier' s =
sex, but Cardinal Fleuri had taught him that it became kings to be impenetr=
able, and Louis remained so all his life. When I got home I gave the eldest=
 Hanoverian twenty guineas, telling her to fetch her marquis out of prison,=
 and bring him to dine with us, as I wanted to know him. I thought she woul=
d have died with joy. The third sister, having taken counsel with Victoire,=
 and doubtless with her mother also, determined to earn twenty guineas for =
herself, and she had not much trouble in doing so. She it was on whom Lord =
Pembroke had cast the eye of desire. These five girls were like five dishes=
 placed before a gourmand, who enjoys them one after the other. To my fancy=
 the last was always the best. The third sister' s name was Augusta. Next S=
unday I had a large number of guests. There were my daughter and her friend=
, Madame Cornelis, and her son. Sophie was kissed and caressed by the Hanov=
erians, while I bestowed a hundred kisses on Miss Nancy Steyne, who was onl=
y thirteen, but whose young beauty worked sad havoc with my senses. My affe=
ction was supposed to be fatherly in its character, but, alas I it was of a=
 much more fleshly kind. This Miss Nancy, who seemed to me almost divine, w=
as the daughter of a rich merchant. I said that I wanted to make her father=
' s acquaintance, and she replied that her father proposed coming to call o=
n me that very day. I was delighted to hear of the coincidence, and gave or=
der that he should be shewn in as soon as he came. The poor marquis was the=
 only sad figure in the company. He was young and well-made, but thin and r=
epulsively ugly. He thanked me for my kindness, saying that I had done a wi=
se thing, as he felt sure the time would come when he would repay me a hund=
redfold. I had given my daughter six guineas to buy a pelisse, and she took=
 me to my bedroom to shew it me. Her mother followed her to congratulate me=
 on my seraglio. At dinner gaiety reigned supreme. I sat between my daughte=
r and Miss Nancy Steyne, and felt happy. Mr. Steyne came in as we were at t=
he oysters. He kissed his daughter with that tender affection which is more=
 characteristic, I think, of English parents than those of any other nation=
 Mr. Steyne had dined, but he nevertheless ate a hundred scolloped oysters=
, in the preparation of which my cook was wonderfully expert; he also honou=
red the champagne with equal attention. We spent three hours at the table a=
nd then proceeded to the third floor, where Sophie accompanied her mother' =
s singing on the piano, and young Cornelis displayed his flute-playing tale=
nts. Mr. Steyne swore that he had never been present at such a pleasant par=
ty in his life, adding that pleasure was forbidden fruit in England on Sund=
ays and holidays. This convinced me that Steyne was an intelligent man, tho=
ugh his French was execrable. He left at seven, after giving a beautiful ri=
ng to my daughter, whom he escorted back to school with Miss Nancy. The Mar=
quis Petina foolishly observed to me that he did not know where to find a b=
ed. I understood what he wanted, but I told him he would easily find one wi=
th a little money. Taking his sweetheart aside I gave her a guinea for him,=
 begging her to tell him not to visit me again till he was invited. When al=
l the guests were gone, I led the five sisters to the mother' s room. She w=
as wonderfully well, eating, drinking, and sleeping to admiration, and neve=
r doing anything, not even reading or writing. She enjoyed the ' dolce far =
niente' in all the force of the term. However, she told me she was always t=
hinking of her family, and of the laws which it imposed on her. I could sca=
rcely help laughing, but I only said that if these laws were the same as th=
ose which her charming daughters followed, I thought them wiser than Solon'=
 s. I drew Augusta on to my knee, and said,-- &quot; My lady, allow me to k=
iss your delightful daughter.&quot; Instead of giving me a direct answer, t=
he old hypocrite began a long sermon on the lawfulness of the parental kiss=
 All the time Augusta was lavishing on me secret but delicious endearments=
 ' O tempora! O mores!' The next day I was standing at my window, when the=
 Marquis Caraccioli, who was passing by, greeted me, and asked me if he cou=
ld come in. I bade him welcome, and summoning the eldest sister told the am=
bassador that this young lady was going to marry the Marquis Petina as soon=
 as his remittances arrived. He addressed himself to her, and spoke as foll=
ows: &quot; Mademoiselle, it is true that your lover is really a marquis, b=
ut he is very poor and will never have any money; and if he goes back to Na=
ples he will be imprisoned, and if he is released from the State prison his=
 creditors will put him in the Vittoria.&quot; However this salutary warnin=
g had no effect. After the ambassador had taken his leave I was dressing to=
 take a ride when Augusta told me that, if I liked, Hippolyta her sister wo=
uld come with me, as she could ride beautifully. &quot; That' s amusing,&qu=
ot; said I, &quot; make her come down.&quot; Hippolyta came down and begged=
 me to let her ride with me, saying that she would do me credit. &quot; Cer=
tainly; &quot; said I, &quot; but have you a man' s riding suit or a woman'=
 s costume?&quot; &quot; No.&quot; &quot; Then we must put off the excursio=
n till to-morrow.&quot; I spent the day in seeing that a suit was made for =
her, and I felt quite amorous when Pegu, the tailor, measured her for the b=
reeches. Everything was done in time and we had a charming ride, for she ma=
naged her horse with wonderful skill. After an excellent supper, to which w=
ine had not been lacking, the happy Hippolyta accompanied Victoire into my =
room and helped her to undress. When she kissed her sister I asked if she w=
ould not give me a kiss too, and after some jesting Augusta changed the jok=
e into earnest by bidding her come to bed beside me, without taking the tro=
uble to ask my leave, so sure did she feel of my consent. The night was wel=
l spent, and I had no reason to complain of want of material, but Augusta w=
isely let the newcomer have the lion' s share of my attentions. Next day we=
 rode out again in the afternoon, followed by my negro, who was a skilful h=
orseman himself. In Richmond Park Hippolyta' s dexterity astonished me; she=
 drew all eyes on her. In the evening we came home well pleased with our da=
y' s ride, and had a good supper. As the meal proceeded I noticed that Gabr=
ielle, the youngest of all, looked sad and a little sulky. I asked her the =
reason, and with a little pout that became her childish face admirably, she=
 replied,-- &quot; Because I can ride on horseback as well as my sister.&qu=
ot; &quot; Very good,&quot; said I, &quot; then you shall ride the day afte=
r to-morrow.&quot; This put her into a good temper again. Speaking of Hippo=
lyta' s skill, I asked her where she had learnt to ride. She simply burst o=
ut laughing. I asked her why she laughed, and she said,-- &quot; Why, becau=
se I never learnt anywhere; my only masters were courage and some natural s=
kill.&quot; &quot; And has your sister learnt?&quot; &quot; No,&quot; said =
Gabrielle, &quot; but I can ride just as well.&quot; I could scarcely belie=
ve it, for Hippolyta had seemed to float on her horse, and her riding skewe=
d the utmost skill and experience. Hoping that her sister would vie with he=
r, I said that I would take them out together, and the very idea made them =
both jump with joy. Gabrielle was only fifteen, and her shape, though not f=
ully developed, was well marked, and promised a perfect beauty by the time =
she was in her maturity. Full of grace and simplicity, she said she would l=
ike to come with me to my room, and I readily accepted her offer, not carin=
g whether the scheme had been concerted between her and her other sisters. =
As soon as we were alone, she told me that she had never had a lover, and s=
he allowed me to assure myself of the fact with the same child- like simpli=
city. Gabrielle was like all the others; I would have chosen her if I had b=
een obliged to make the choice. She made me feel sorry for her sake, to hea=
r that the mother had made up her mind to leave. In the morning I gave her =
her fee of twenty guineas and a handsome ring as a mark of my peculiar frie=
ndship, and we spent the day in getting ready our habits for the ride of th=
e day following. Gabrielle got on horseback as if she had had two years in =
the riding school. We went along the streets at a walking pace, but as soon=
 as we were in the open country we broke into a furious gallop, and kept it=
 up till we got to Barnet, where we stopped to breakfast. We had done the j=
ourney in twenty-five minutes, although the distance is nearly ten miles. T=
his may seem incredible, but the English horses are wonderfully swift, and =
we were all of us well mounted. My two nymphs looked ravishing. I adored th=
em, and I adored myself for making them so happy. Just as we were remountin=
g, who should arrive but Lord Pembroke. He was on his way to St. Alban' s. =
He stopped his horse, and admired the graceful riding of my two companions;=
 and not recognizing them immediately, he begged leave to pay his court to =
them. How I laughed to myself! At last he recognized them, and congratulate=
d me on my conquest, asking if I loved Hippolyta. I guessed his meaning, an=
d said I only loved Gabrielle. &quot; Very good,&quot; said he; &quot; may =
I come and see you?&quot; &quot; Certainly,&quot; I replied. After a friend=
ly hand-shake we set out once more, and were soon back in London. Gabrielle=
 was done up and went to bed directly; she slept on till the next morning w=
ithout my disturbing her peaceful sleep, and when she awoke and found herse=
lf in my arms, she began to philosophise. &quot; How easy it is,&quot; said=
 she, &quot; to be happy when one is rich, and how sad it is to see happine=
ss out of one' s reach for lack of a little money. Yesterday I was the happ=
iest of beings, and why should I not be as happy all my days? I would gladl=
y agree that my life should be short provided that it should be a happy one=
&quot; I, too, philosophised, but my reflections were sombre. I saw my res=
ources all but exhausted, and I began to meditate a journey to Lisbon. If m=
y fortune had been inexhaustible, the Hanoverians might have held me in the=
ir silken fetters to the end of my days. It seemed to me as if I loved them=
 more like a father than a lover, and the fact that I slept with them only =
added to the tenderness of the tie. I looked into Gabrielle' s eyes, and th=
ere I saw but love. How could such a love exist in her unless she were natu=
rally virtuous, and yet devoid of those prejudices which are instilled into=
 us in our early years. The next day Pembroke called and asked me to give h=
im a dinner. Augusta delighted him. He made proposals to her which excited =
her laughter as he did not want to pay till after the event, and she would =
not admit this condition. However, he gave her a bank note for ten guineas =
before he left, and she accepted it with much grace. The day after he wrote=
 her a letter, of which I shall speak presently. A few minutes after the no=
bleman had gone the mother sent for me to come to her, and after paying an =
eloquent tribute to my virtues, my generosity, and my unceasing kindness to=
wards her family, she made the following proposal: &quot; As I feel sure th=
at you have all the love of a father for my daughters, I wish you to become=
 their father in reality! I offer you my hand and heart; become my husband,=
 you will be their father, their lord and mine. What do you say to this?&qu=
ot; I bit my lips hard and had great difficulty in restraining my inclinati=
on to laughter. Nevertheless, the amazement, the contempt, and the indignat=
ion which this unparalleled piece of impudence aroused in me soon brought m=
e to myself. I perceived that this consummate hypocrite had counted on an a=
brupt refusal, and had only made this ridiculous offer with the idea of con=
vincing me that she was under the impression that I had left her daughters =
as I had found them, and that the money I had spent on them was merely a si=
gn of my tender and fatherly affection. Of course she knew perfectly well h=
ow the land lay, but she thought to justify herself by taking this step. Sh=
e was aware that I could only look upon such a proposal as an insult, but s=
he did not care for that. I resolved to keep on the mask, and replied that =
her proposition was undoubtedly a very great honour for me, but it was also=
 a very important question, and so I begged her to allow me some time for c=
onsideration. When I got back to my room I found there the mistress of the =
wretched Marquis Petina, who told me that her happiness depended on a certi=
ficate from the Neapolitan ambassador that her lover was really the person =
he professed to be. With this document he would be able to claim a sum of t=
wo hundred guineas, and then they could both go to Naples, and he would mar=
ry her there. &quot; He will easily obtain the royal pardon,&quot; said she=
 &quot; You, and you alone, can help us in the matter, and I commend mysel=
f to your kindness.&quot; I promised to do all I could for her. In fact, I =
called on the ambassador, who made no difficulty about giving the required =
certificate. For the moment my chilly conquest was perfectly happy, but tho=
ugh I saw she was very grateful to me I did not ask her to prove her gratit=
ude. CHAPTER XVI Augusta Becomes Lord Pembroke' s Titular Mistress The King=
 of Corsica' s Son--M. du Claude, or the Jesuit Lavalette--Departure of the=
 Hanoverians I Balance My Accounts--The Baron Stenau--The English Girl, and=
 What She Gave Me--Daturi--My Flight from London--Comte St. Germain--Wesel =
Lord Pembroke wrote to Augusta offering her fifty guineas a month for three=
 years, with lodging, board, servants, and carriage at St. Albans, without =
reckoning what she might expect from his grateful affection if it were retu=
rned. Augusta translated the letter for me, and asked for my advice. &quot;=
 I can' t give you any counsel,&quot; said I, &quot; in a matter which only=
 concerns your own heart and your own interests.&quot; She went up to her m=
other, who would come to no conclusion without first consulting me, because=
, as she said, I was the wisest and most virtuous of men. I am afraid the r=
eader will differ from her here, but I comfort myself by the thought that I=
, too, think like the reader. At last it was agreed that Augusta should acc=
ept the offer if Lord Pembroke would find a surety in the person of some re=
putable London merchant, for with her beauty and numerous graces she was su=
re to, become Lady Pembroke before long. Indeed, the mother said she was pe=
rfectly certain of it, as otherwise she could not have given her consent, a=
s her daughters were countesses, and too good to be any man' s mistresses. =
The consequence was that Augusta wrote my lord a letter, and in three days =
it was all settled. The merchant duly signed the contract, at the foot of w=
hich I had the honour of inscribing my name as a witness, and then I took t=
he merchant to the mother, and he witnessed her cession of her daughter. Sh=
e would not see Pembroke, but she kissed her daughter, and held a private c=
olloquy with her. The day on which Augusta left my house was signalized by =
an event which I must set down. The day after I had given the Marquis Petin=
a' s future bride the required certificate, I had taken out Gabrielle and H=
ippolyta for a ride. When I got home I found waiting for me a person callin=
g himself Sir Frederick, who was said to be the son of Theodore, King of Co=
rsica, who had died in London. This gentleman said he wished to speak to me=
 in private, and when we were alone he said he was aware of my acquaintance=
 with the Marquis Petina, and being on the eve of discounting a bill of two=
 hundred guineas for him he wished to be informed whether it was likely tha=
t he could meet the bill when it fell due. &quot; It is important that I sh=
ould be informed on that point,&quot; he added, &quot; for the persons who =
are going to discount the bill want me to put my signature to it.&quot; &qu=
ot; Sir,&quot; I replied, &quot; I certainly am acquainted with the marquis=
, but I know nothing about his fortune. However, the Neapolitan ambassador =
assured me that he was the Marquis Petina.&quot; &quot; If the persons who =
have the matter in hand should drop it, would you discount the bill? You sh=
all have it cheap.&quot; &quot; I never meddle with these speculations. Goo=
d day, Sir Frederick.&quot; The next day Goudar came and said that a M. du =
Claude wanted to speak to me. &quot; Who is M. du Claude?&quot; &quot; The =
famous Jesuit Lavalette, who was concerned in the great bankruptcy case whi=
ch ruined the Society in France. He fled to England under a false name. I a=
dvise you to listen to him, for he must have plenty of money.&quot; &quot; =
A Jesuit and a bankrupt; that does not sound very well.&quot; &quot; Well, =
I have met him in good houses, and knowing that I was acquainted with you h=
e addressed himself to me. After all, you run no risk in listening to what =
he has to say.&quot; &quot; Well, well, you can take me to him; it will be =
easier to avoid any entanglement than if he came to see me.&quot; Goudar we=
nt to Lavalette to prepare the way, and in the afternoon he took me to see =
him. I was well enough pleased to see the man, whose rascality had destroye=
d the infamous work of many years. He welcomed me with great politeness, an=
d as soon as we were alone he shewed me a bill of Petina' s, saying,-- &quo=
t; The young man wants me to discount it, and says you can give me the nece=
ssary information.&quot; I gave the reverend father the same answer as I ha=
d given the King of Corsica' s son, and left him angry with this Marquis of=
 Misery who had given me so much needless trouble. I was minded to have don=
e with him, and resolved to let him know through his mistress that I would =
not be his reference, but I could not find an opportunity that day. The nex=
t day I took my two nymphs for a ride, and asked Pembroke to dinner. In vai=
n we waited for Petina' s mistress; she was nowhere to be found. At nine o'=
 clock I got a letter from her, with a German letter enclosed for her mothe=
r. She said that feeling certain that her mother would not give her consent=
 to her marriage, she had eloped with her lover, who had got together enoug=
h money to go to Naples, and when they reached that town he would marry her=
 She begged me to console her mother and make her listen to reason, as she=
 had not gone off with an adventurer but with a man of rank, her equal. My =
lips curled into a smile of pity and contempt, which made the three sisters=
 curious. I shewed them the letter I had just received, and asked them to c=
ome with me to their mother. &quot; Not to-night,&quot; said Victoire, &quo=
t; this terrible news would keep her awake.&quot; I took her advice and we =
supped together, sadly enough. I thought the poor wretch was ruined for lif=
e, and I reproached myself with being the cause of her misfortune; for if I=
 had not released the marquis from prison this could never have happened. T=
he Marquis Caraccioli had been right in saying that I had done a good deed,=
 but a foolish one. I consoled myself in the arms of my dear Gabrielle. I h=
ad a painful scene with the mother the next morning. She cursed her daughte=
r and her seducer, and even blamed me. She wept and stormed alternately. It=
 is never of any use to try and convince people in distress that they are w=
rong, for one may only do harm, while if they are left to themselves they s=
oon feel that they have been unjust, and are grateful to the person who let=
 them exhaust their grief without any contradiction. After this event I spe=
nt a happy fortnight in the society of Gabrielle, whom Hippolyta and Victoi=
re looked on as my wife. She made my happiness and I made hers in all sorts=
 of ways, but especially by my fidelity; for I treated her sisters as if th=
ey had been my sisters, shewing no recollection of the favours I had obtain=
ed from them, and never taking the slightest liberty, for I knew that frien=
dship between women will hardly brook amorous rivalry. I had bought them dr=
esses and linen in abundance, they were well lodged and well fed, I took th=
em to the theatre and to the country, and the consequence was they all ador=
ed me, and seemed to think that this manner of living would go on for ever.=
 Nevertheless, I was every day nearer and nearer to moral and physical bank=
