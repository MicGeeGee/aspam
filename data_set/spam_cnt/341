<a style="text-decoration:none; color:#D7D7D7; display:block; text-align:justify; padding-top:150px" href="http://pruia.megamasterdhop.com">Look people would remark What a pity A young fellow that age tied to a woman of fortyfive He must be twenty years younger than his wife They had forgottenas people inevitably forgetthat back in  their mammas and papas had also remarked about this same illmatched pair

Benjamins grog unhappiness at home was compensated for by his many new interests He took up golf and made a great success of it He went in for dancing in  he was an expert at The Boston and in  he was considered proficient at the Maxine while in  his Castle Walk was the envy of every young man in town

His social activities of course interfered to some extent with his business but then he had worked  at wholesale ware for twentyfive years and felt that he could soon hand it on to his son Roscoe who had recently graduated from Harvard

He and his son were in fact often mistaken for each other This pleased Benjaminhe soon forgot the insidious fear which had come over him on his return from the SpanishAmerican War and grew to take a nave pleasure in his appearance There was only one fly in the delicious ointmenthe hated to appear in public with his wife Hildegarde was almost fifty and the sight of her made him feel absurd

Say he said to Roscoe one day Ive told you over and over that I want to go to prep school

Well go then replied Roscoe shortly The matter was distasteful to him and he wished to avoid a discussion

I cant go alone said Benjamin helplessly Youll have to enter me and take me up there

I havent got time declared Roscoe abruptly His eyes narrowed and he looked uneasily at his father As a matter of fact he added youd better not go on with this business much longer You better pull up short You betteryou betterhe paused and his face crimsoned as he sought for wordsyou better turn right around and start back the other way This has gone too far to be a joke It isnt funny any longer Youyou behave yourself
