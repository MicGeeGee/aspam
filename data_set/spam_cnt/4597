      <td style="color: #E5E5E5">Once When he called at my lodgings in London Some three yearsor three years and a half ago

  Can you identify him as your fellowpassenger on board the packetor speak to his conversation with your daughter

  SirI can do neither

  Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either

  He answeredin a low voiceThere is

  Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonmentwithout trialor even accusationin your native countryDoctor Manette

  He answeredin a tone that went to every heartA long imprisonment

  Were you newly released on the occasion in question

      <td style="color: #E5E5E5"> y to pass between any young gentleman and young lady so thrown togetherwith the exception of that reference to George Washingtonwhich was altogether too extravagant and impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies and fearsand therefore Mr AttorneyGeneral had made the most of it howneverthelessit rested upon nothingsave that vile and infamous character of evidence too often disfiguring such casesand of which the State Trials of this country were full Butthere my Lord interposed with as grave a face as if it had not been truesaying that he could not sit upon that Bench and suffer those allusions

  Mr Stryver then called his few witnessesand Mr Cruncher had next to attend while Mr AttorneyGeneral turned the whole suit of clothes Mr Stryver had fitted on the juryinside out shog how Barsad and Cly were even a  times better than he had thought themand the prisoner a  times worse Lastlycame my Lord himselfturning the suit of clothesnow inside outnow outside inbut on the whole decidedly trimming and shaping them into graveclothes for the prisoner

  And nowthe jury turned to considerand the great flies swarmed again

  Mr Cartonwho had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the courtchanged neither his place nor his attitudeeven in this excitement While his learned friendMr Stryvermassing his papers before himwhispered with those who sat nearand from time to time glanced anxiously at the jury while all the

  Yetthis Mr Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he appeared to take in for nowwhen Miss Manettes head dropped upon her fathers he was the first to see itand to say audibly Officer look to that young lady Help the gentleman to take her out Dont you see she will fall

  There was much commiseration for her as she was removedand much sympathy with her father It had evidently been a great distress to himto have the days of his imprisonment recalled He had shown strong internal agitation when he was questionedand that pondering or brooding look which made him oldhad been upon himlike a heavy cloudever since As he passed outthe jurywho had turned back and paused a momentspokethrough their foreman
