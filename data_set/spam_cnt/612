Summer 2016: New Home Roofing Discounts, only here: http://tryit.boredvf.top/startnow


This place was delicious! We were also starving, so that helped. The service was great, the local beer refreshing, and the pizza was awesome. We ordered the... This was just what I wanted from a local seafood option. Among us we had a halibut sandwich and the chowder and mussels in a sauce that was garlic... INCREDIBLE. I eat Thai everywhere I go. The quality and the portions are absolutely right for the price. The service is beautiful. The environment is... We are not on one of the cruise ships so we were a bit wary of heading towards the harbor after a day of dodging the passengers in town. So glad we braved... Not that I'm an expert in fish and chips, but this is best I've ever had.  Highly recommended.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

As if this place needs more good reviews, but thought I would keep the good thoughts going. ..My husband and I stopped here during our cruise, I had read the... Amazing food in a part of the world where I least expected to find it. I highly recommend the Mataar Paneer and Saag Paneer. Had an amazing absolutely amazing meal here this evening. Husband had a melt in your mouth prime rib dinner. Tried both the mushroom \u0026 the fennel sausage... The food was good, service outstanding. Prices were a bit high but they were super friendly even with our 4 kids, even going as far as to helping my 2 year... Was in town to see a show and needed a place to eat, the reviews and pics looked good, so we went here.....Food was delicious, staff was friendly, prices were... My son had the pizza and it was quite good. I had a grinder and it was great. Neat place with a great atmosphere. Server was friendly and attentive. Good Mexican food -- much better than the franchise Mexican in town. Nice variety un the menu. We enjoyed our wet burrito and enchiladas. Just had lunch here on our way back to Battle Creek. They have a nice variety of items on their menu. I had a chicken burrito which was tasty. My husband... I rarely make time to review restaurants but I felt obligated tonight based on our great experience. My chicken quesadilla was phenomenal; the best I've had... This place singlehandedly makes me love Indian food.  It is amazing to me that a town as small as Mount Pleasant has a restaurant as good as Bombay... The boneless Buffaloes with garlic Parmesan cheese is great, sweet nachos with cheese cake balls is wonderful My favorite place in town for a big lunch salad. The subs are warm and good too but the salad is fresh, and large. Thank you, Yelpers!....I was looking for burger/beer place in Mt. Pleasant before attending an event at CMU ... the reviews suggested I give it a try \u0026 now...f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
