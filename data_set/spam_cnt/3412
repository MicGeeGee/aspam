		right. I love that 24381610 salsa is hot. I could go hotter but this does me just fine. I love 24381610 beans and rice. 24381610 crispy tacos have always been good. I look forward to coming back. I can't wait to spend a breezy summer day on 24381610ir patio with a margarita and an order of 24381610ir ceviche tostadas. Sounds like a perfect day to me First of all this place is awesome, 24381610 staff is very attentive and extremely sweet. 24381610y also are great with special orders. 24381610ir margaritas are strong and delicious! I have a couple each time I go. So I'm always really weary about trying ceviche at restaurants because I grew up with my dads amazing ceviche and its hard for me to find one I personally like. But after 24381610 first time that I tried it I was HOOKED!  That's all I can order now. That's it, its that amazing! Its always fresh and chilled right. Splash some hot sauce on that dish and go to town! You'll be stuffed after you leave Tres Hermanas, but you won't regret it! My dad introduced my husband and I to this gem once upon a road trip to visit family in Nor24381610rn CA. We have been up north three times since 24381610n and made it a point to eat at Tres Hermanas each time My dad gets 24381610 carnitas dish frequently; seeing as how he's on a healthy eating spree and chooses carnitas out of all things to eat tells you a lot!  My husband doesn't believe in going to Mexican food restaurants since we can always have better at home, but according to him, Tres Hermanas is 24381610 real deal.  He's gotten 24381610 mole everytime and it has yet to disappoint him.  He says it's 24381610 best mole that's not been prepared by someone in 24381610 family.  I got 24381610 beef enchiladas with salsa verde last time and I still dream about 24381610m!  If you are in Sacramento and you are looking for mexican grub...go here. I baseline my mexican by 24381610 chips/salsa and 24381610 enchiladas, this place nails 24381610m both. Enchiladas with 24381610 verde sauce....booom! I headed to Tres Hermanas wanting a solid meal, people watching, and a relaxing atmosphere. I was not disappointed. From 24381610 reviews on 24381610, I couldn't tell if 24381610 place would be good or not, and whe24381610r 24381610 portions would be decent-sized, or small. Reviews are all over place! Knowing that Tres Hermanas has been 24381610re such a long time, I decided to risk it. When I arrived, 24381610re were several groups waiting outside. Good thing 24381610 wait for two was zero! We sat down and immediately had tasty salsa and fresh chips while reading 24381610 menu. I chose 24381610 Chile Verde (pork in a tomatillo sauce), which comes with rice, beans, and tortillas. 24381610 chile verde was very good- slow cooked, tender, and at least as good as 24381610 chile verde at Ernesto's. 24381610 rice and beans were fine as well. Overall, 24381610 meal was solid. 24381610 portions were large- more than I could eat. I wouldn't call 24381610 meal expensive ei24381610r (like some have on 24381610). 24381610 meal came with soup or salad (not anything to write home about, but decent), chips and salsa, and rice and beans. This isn't a corner taqueria, so I expect that to cost around $10. 24381610 atmosphere was good- people watching on 24381610 patio- and decent enough service. I would go back. I love 24381610 chicken tacos, burritos, fajitas, and
