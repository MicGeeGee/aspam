<span style="color:#fff;  line-height:4px; line-height:2px; position:absolute">  I think you have been drinkingMr Carton

  Think You know I have been drinking

  Since I must say soI know it

  Then you shall likewise know why I am a disappointed drudgesir I care for no man on earthand no man on earth cares for me

  Much to be regretted You might have used your talents better

  May be soMr Darnay may be not Dont let your sober face elate youhowever you dont know what it may come to Good night

  When he was left alonethis strange being took up a candlewent to a glass that hung against the walland surveyed himself minutely in it

  Do you particularly like the man he mutteredat his own image why should you particularly like a man who resembles you There is nothing in you to like you know that Ahconfound you What a change you have made in yourself A good reason for taking to a manthat he shows you what you have fallen away fromand what you might have been Change places with himand would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he wasand commiserated by that agitated face as he was Come onand have it out in plain words You hate the fellow

  He resorted to his pint of e for consolationdrank it all in a few minutesand fell asleep on his armswith his hair straggling over the tableand a long dingsheet in the candle dripping down upon him

  A favourite at the Old Baileyand eke at the SessionsMr Stryver had begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which he mounted Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favouritespeciallyto their longing arms and shouldering itself towards the visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of Kings Benchthe florid countenance of Mr Stryver might be daily seenbursting out of the bed of wigslike a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from among a rank gardenfull of flaring companions

  It had once been noted at the Barthat while Mr Stryver was a glib manand an unscrupulousand a readyand a boldhe had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statementswhich is among the most striking and necessary of the advocates accomplishments Buta remarkable improvement came upon him as to this The more business he gotthe greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith and marrow and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney Cartonhe always had his points at his fingers ends in the morning
