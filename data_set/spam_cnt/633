He told Irish broadcaster RTE that Apple had not been given preferential tax breaks in Ireland
The EU ruling said Apple had been given 13bn of illegal tax benefits
Mr Cook said he was very confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal</td>

      <td style="color:#142E3F">Outrage
On Tuesday the European Commission said Ireland had granted undue tax benefits of up to 13bn (11bn to Apple
Speaking about the ruling Mr Cook told RTE: Its maddening its disappointing its clear that this comes from a political place it has no basis in fact or in law and unfortunately its one of those things we have to work through
When youre accused of doing something that is so foreign to your values it brings out an outrage in you and thats how we feel Apple has always been about doing the right thing
<br><br>
We havent done anything wrong and the Irish government hasnt done anything wrong
Mr Cook disputed the Commissions finding that Apple had effectively paid a corporate tax rate of just 0005 or 50 out of every 1m from one of its Ireland-based subsidiaries in 2014
Its a false number I have no idea where the number came from It is not true Here is the truth In that year we paid 400m to Ireland and that amount of money was based on the statutory Irish income tax rate of 125

However the European Commission said the rate of 0005 applied to one of Apples subsidiaries
Apple Sales International made research payments totalling 2bn to its parent Apple Inc in 2011 which significantly increased in 2014 the Commission said
Apple paid an effective tax rate of 0005 in 2014 on the profits of Apple Sales International
Apple has more subsidiaries in Ireland as indicated in the Commissions decision to open an investigation
The tax affairs of other Apple subsidiaries be it in Ireland or elsewhere have not been the focus of this investigation it said

But Apple said it was the largest corporate taxpayer in Ireland in 2014
He said Apple paid income tax on products sold in different European countries to those countries and an additional income taxes on profits in the US at a rate of 35
In addition Apple has provisioned several  dollars from its profits in 2014 to be repatriated to the US he said
Right now I would forecast that repatriation to occur next year Its not true that we paid just 400m or even just 800m [to Ireland and the US combined]  the number is materially larger
In 2014 our worldwide income tax rate was 261 Mr Cook added
