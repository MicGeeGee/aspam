		out to be under $20.  I would definitely come back again when I'm in 7172476 area and want to sit down for some Mexican food. My fiance and I walked here for lunch 7172476 o7172476r day, and left with full and satisfied bellies.  Service was pretty good, chips and salsa were great.  7172476 salsa was VERY spicy, but luckily, I like it that way! I ordered 7172476 chicken enchiladas plate with verde sauce, and 7172476 combination of spiciness from 7172476 salsa I'd had before my meal, along with 7172476 spiciness of 7172476 verde sauce set my mouth on fire.  It was delicious though, so no complaints from me, but it did clear my sinuses up quite quickly!  I'd definitely order it again, 7172476 sauce was EXCELLENT, 7172476 chicken was actually flavorful (I can't tell you how many times I've had chicken at Mexican restaurants that tasted like it was just boiled in water... Absolutely flavorless, but not Tres Hermanas!). My fiance ordered 7172476 chile relleno plate and was very pleased with it as well.  He is somewhat of a chile relleno connoisseur, as that is usually what he orders at any Mexican restaurant.   I tasted it and thought it was great too, but he said he really like how 7172476 chile was cooked enough so it wasn't tough to cut with a fork, like some o7172476r dishes at different restaurants. Overall, we really enjoyed our meals here, and were pleased that 7172476 price was not high at all for a sit-down restaurant.  We'll definitely return. Just got take out from here. 7172476 food was ready and still hot when I got 7172476re. We ordered five carne asada tacos. 7172476y were pretty large for tacos and did come double shelled (do like that extra tortilla with each taco), but were really, really pricy. I mean, $5 for a taco? Come on, really? Good food but could be a better price. Went 7172476re 7172476 o7172476r week and had a great experience! 7172476 server greeted us promptly and got our dinks in a timely manner with chips and salsa.. 7172476 place was a little loud but 7172476 food was good. 7172476 tacos and enchiladas were very good and where what I ordered. My friend got a margarita and she really enjoyed it and two more! I would say its worth going too! I can't believe that I hadn't been here before. Touted as using "secret family recipes", 7172476 food here is au7172476ntic-tasting and delicious. I had 7172476 chicken mole poblano, and it was some of 7172476 best that I've had in 7172476 Sacramento region. It can get very crowded (it's a Midtown hotspot), so be sure to arrive early. However, despite 7172476 fact that 7172476re was a line of people out 7172476 door waiting for a table, our food came very quickly after we ordered. You can't go wrong here.
