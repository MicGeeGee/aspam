La Tarasca will probably be different than the Mexican food most people are used to because this stuff is the real deal. And it's fantastic.....Some... Why hate on this place? Yeah, the proprietor is gruff, they only take cash, and service is slow. What did you expect, Chez Panisse? The Bay Area this is... Pretty good if you know what to order. I loved the mac and cheese. Also the fries are pretty good but the ketchup they use is to die for! Portland ketchup... My girlfriend and I really enjoyed a very good dinner at Mackinaw's.....I am new in the area, so we wanted something with ambiance and quaint.  Service was... With hubby driving to Waco, I myself looking at the phone, just happened to glance up and there she was COCOAMODA!  I didn't even think we would be passing... Pass thru Hearne often between Houston \u0026 Ft Worth and have been wanting to try it out.   But, we were hesitant after reading some of the reviews. ....Glad we... not only is the food amazingly good, the service is outstanding.  ..The wine list has some great choices and also at affordable prices.   ..Went with a party... This place was packed on Friday night! My spaghetti with pink sauce and side of veggies was absolutely delicious. My husband's pizza with veggies was really... What a wonderful evening at Christopher's ....There were 6 of us on a golfing trip to Traditions. Amber was our waitress and she is \"outstanding\" ....Our 6... Great evening for drinks and dinner. We had Krystal\"s Splash and a Margarita Montelongo. Ian was our bartender and was great. ....We had the Stuffed Avocado,... Great spot for a nicer dining experience with quality steaks at a decent price. Excellent service as well! The happy hour is definitely the draw for me here. $4.00 Trash can punch! It's so good it almost tastes non alcoholic but trust me, after about 2 you'll... The best hamburger and fries...add the fried egg it's worth it..friendly service highly recommendf8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047</p>
