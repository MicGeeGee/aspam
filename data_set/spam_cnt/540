  Mr Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced to take hisand he put it with some ceremony to his lips He then conducted the young lady straightway to her chair againandholding the chairback with his left handand using his right by turns to rub his chinpull his wig at the earsor point what he saidstood looking down into her face while she sat looking up into his

  She didindeedstart And she caught his wrist with both her hands

  Praysaid Mr Lorryin a soothing tonebringing his left hand from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped him in so violent a tremble pray control your agitationa matter of business As I was saying

  Her look so discomposed him that he stoppedwanderedand began anew
