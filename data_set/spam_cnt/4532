Important Medicare Information
Announcement: 15472971-2016
------------------------------------------

Medicare Applicant or Recipient bruce@untroubled.org,

Did you know your first 6 months of Medigap eligibility are the most important?

* During this time you can buy any Medigap policy the company sells, even if you have health problems, for the same price as people with good health.
* Once this period expires, companies can charge you more or decline coverage.
* Eligibility begins the month you turn 65 and are enrolled in Medicare Part B.

Why should you compare quotes?

* Typically cost is the only difference between Medigap policies sold by different insurance companies.
* Every Medicare Supplemental insurance provider has to follow federal and state laws designed to make the buying process easier for the consumer.
* This means Medigap insurance companies can only sell you a "standardized" Medigap policy identified by letters A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M and N.
* Because of these laws, each standardized Medigap policy must offer the same basic benefits, no matter what price the insurance company sells it for.
