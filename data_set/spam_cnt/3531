This equally applies to people who are missing a few teeth as well as those who have lost all of their teeth. They look and behave in the same way as your natural teeth and have proved to be a popular alternative to missing teeth.

Dental technology is advancing all the time and this can be seen in the field of dentures. Modern dentures are made from a variety of materials which includes acrylic resins and the revolutionary flexible denture.
