My 1000th review goes to The Blind Rabbit, cheers!....If you're planning to visit Anaheim Packing District, make sure you make reservations to The Blind... Good old Roman Cucina. Like an old friend who is always there, RC offers a familiar menu. Alfredo, pink sauce, marinara. All done simply with fresh pastas.... Last birthday surprise!....We arrived 30 minutes prior to our reservation, and they were nice enough to seat us early. They brought out a wheel of bread, and... This review is mostly based off their meatball subs. I've had some canolis and the pizza once, but neither stood out like the meatball subs! ....Quick Review:... This place is not cheap but it is so worth every penny.....If you want a simple but delish dish, I like the Chicken Pita Wrap. It comes with their yummy... Bistro Bleu is great. Pre fixe with FOUR courses for $36?! Pretty darn good considering the service and quality of food.....The escargot is different thf8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

Pre fixe with FOUR courses for $36?! Pretty darn good considering the service and quality of food.....The escargot is different than any... Was looking for a good pizza close to home after coming back from NYC last week. Found one here at Fuoco. Tough cuz I had pizza in New York and Amalfi... I can never ever get enough of this tasty delicious food and the girls that work there are just great! I can never ever get enough of this tasty delicious... This place is so fire!!  literally all you can want from a restaurant like this. Super low prices, quality food, excellent service. ....I got the Japanese... I think Boz-Wellz is a real find in Storm Lake. ....Located downtown, one street off the main drag, Boz-Wellz is a great spot for lunch or dinner.  I ate here... Love the view and peach sangria but we went there for Wing Wednesday and the prices were outrageous! $14.99 for 12 wings for a special?!?! This is Iowa people! One of the best places to eat in Storm Lake. It has a sports bar atmosphere with sporting equipment and signed dollar bills covering the walls. I've never... What a great place!  We stopped here on the way home from the Badlands.  There's not many options along highway 20 and decided to venture off the highway... Good Chicken.

They had the tables set up in long rows. Only 2 servers for a group of about 60 people.... Probably one of my favorite restaurants. Their plates are so large and full that even I have trouble finishing my plate of food sometimes!....Service is... The new four lane US20 across Iowa is a Godsend for drivers but it means that travelers also miss gems like Cede's Bark Bistro and Tea With Lillian. The...f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
