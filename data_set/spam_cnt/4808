Dear Beloved Friend,

I believe that you have not forgotten me, although it was indeed a very lon=
g time we communicate last. Well, this is to thank you for your past effort=
 to assist me in moving out late Mr. Alvin Peter's funds out from the Bank =
East Asia New York at that time, I understand your thought that time, that =
I wasn't for real and you said that Is fraud but I told you that is not fra=
ud and you understood me and did your best to assist me but could not concl=
ude the transaction with me. I thank God for his grace and favor upon my li=
fe because there was a man called Phua Chu Kang from Japan  who finally hel=
ped me to move the money to his account so the Bank East Asia did not seize=
 or divert the funds of late Alvin peter any more who died on the plane cra=
sh on 11th of September 2001 Terror Attack you can view the link to know mo=
re about him(http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/memorial/people/2632.html) .I=
 thank God very much for all He has done.

I am so glad to write this email to you today, God is really wonderful and =
so kind to me, God makes a way where there is no way, I did not believe tha=
t I will move out from New York by now, but God has made it possible for me=
. So I am happy to inform you about my success in getting those funds trans=
ferred under my new partner from Tokyo City, Japan, I am currently in the T=
okyo City  for my Oil and Gas investment  here in the Japan, Meanwhile, I d=
id not forget all your past efforts and attempts to assist me that time in =
transferring those funds despite that it failed us some how due to one reas=
on or the other. But because i made a promise to God that i must surely com=
pensate you as the first person who tried all your best to help me despite =
that you did not conclude the transaction but i could not forget your good =
advice and encouragement which gave me at that time.

Now i want you to contact our parish priest: Reverend Fr. JOHN BOB WATSON w=
ho used to be a good father to me when I was in New York, his e-mail addres=

United State Dollars, which I prepared for you and kept for your compensati=
on for all efforts and attempts to assist me in this matter, knowing fully =
well that I would have not succeeded if not your advice and encouragement t=
o me at that time. Please accept this little token as it is, but I really a=
ppreciate your efforts at that time very much. So feel free to contact Rev.=
