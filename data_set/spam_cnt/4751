It was on the smaller side but they made efficient use of the space... Exceeded our expectations!  We just had dinner at the restaurant and truly enjoyed it.  Our food (broiled trout and prime rib) was very good, best baked... There's a lot to love about this gem in Clifton Forge. For one, it's in a building that has long been a restaurant and retains many of its original 1930s... This is only my second time here, but both times, the food and service were amazing. Patient bartenders recommend cocktails and deliver the best. The food... Pretty good Mexican with convenient location for Rockwood and Gibraltar residents.....I would recommend the fajitas. The dining area is very small, so To Go... That was the best Pizza I have ever had, it steals away the previous title holder for me...Main Street Pizza in Johnson City, TN....  The atmosphere was... For breakfast had the meatloaf dinner....Very tasty.   Side of mashed potatoes and green beans with bean soup.....While the food was very good, like always it... Great food when you need that awesome burger and some deep fried yummy stuff. We had the deep fried cauliflower, pickles, and half pound cheeseburger... So I'm really surprised to read a few of the reviews on here. On my way to a meeting I had some time to spare today so I stopped in at this low key cafe... We love it here, charming atmosphere \u0026 always great food. Pizza is good but we've had several different meals over the years and always leave happy. Wine... Saved again!  Searching for a quick pick-up dinner near Brownstown. Me needing a lower carb option with a more normal meal. This was the perfect place.... I don't have enough words to express how amazing the staff is at this restaurant. We rolled in with roughly 50 high school students, without any notice.... Local hole in the wall bar cheap drinks! You get what you pay for so if you're looking for a place to regret the next day here's your spotf8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
