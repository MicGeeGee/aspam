<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Top Benefits of Rhinoplasty</p>

<!-- Paragraph 1 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Rhinoplasty may stop or reduce snoring, as well as other sleep problems. 23% of couples sleep in separate bedrooms because of their partner???s loud snoring which interrupts their sleeping and makes it uncomfortable to be in the same bed as their partners</p>

<!-- Paragraph 2 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Rhinoplasty may be combined with sinus surgery to fix breathing problems and chronic sinusitis. Sinusitis means your sinuses are inflamed. The cause can be an infection or another problem of the nose which can produce mucus, which drains into the nose. If your nose is swollen, this can block the sinuses and cause pain.</p>

<!-- Paragraph 3 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Many patients believe that the nose job surgery improves their careers and contributes to their success and power on the job. Many individuals also get rhinoplasty to stay competitive in the job market and look younger.</p>

<!-- Paragraph 4 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">The nose is the most commonly broken facial bone. Rhinoplasty can improve injury related nasal deformities. Causes of a broken nose are related to trauma to the nose or face.
