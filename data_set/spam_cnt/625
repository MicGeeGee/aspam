   The watchful guardwith his right hand at the stock of his raised blunderbusshis left at the barreland his eye on the horsemananswered curtlySir

  There is nothing to apprehend I belong to Tellsons Bank You must know Tellsons Bank in London I am going to Paris on business A crown to drink I may read this

  If so be as youre quicksir

  He opened it in the light of the coachlamp on that sideand readfirst to himself and then aloud Wait at Dover for Mamselle Its not longyou seeguard Jerrysay that my answer wasRecalled to life

  Jerry started in his saddle Thats a Blazing strange answertoosaid heat his hoarsest

  Take that message backand they will know that I received thisas well as if I wrote Make the best of your way Good night

  With those words the passenger opened the coachdoor and got in not at all assisted by his fellowpassengerswho had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their bootsand were now making a general pretence of being asleep With no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action

  The coach lumbered on againwith heavier wreaths of mist closing round it as it began the descent The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss in his armchestandhaving looked to the rest of its contentsand having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his beltlooked to a smaller chest beneath his seatin which there were a few smiths toolsa couple of torchesand a tinderbox For he was furnished with that completeness that if the coachlamps had been blown and stormed outwhich did occasionally happenhe had only to shut himself up insidekeep the flint and steel sparks well off the strawand get a light with tolerable safety and ease if he were lucky in five minutes

  Tom softly over the coach roof

  HalloJoe

  Did you hear the message

  I didJoe

  What did you make of itTom

  Nothing at allJoe

  Thats a coincidencetoothe guard musedfor I made the same of it myself

  Jerryleft alone in the mist and darknessdismounted meanwhilenot only to ease his spent horsebut to wipe the mud from his faceand shake the wet out of his hatbrimwhich might be capable of holding about half a gallon After standing with the bridle over his heavilysplashed armuntil the wheels of the mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still againhe turned to walk down the hill

  After that there gallop from Temple Barold ladyI t trust your forelegs till I get you on the levelsaid this hoarse messengerglancing at his mare Recalled to life Thats a Blazing strange message Much of that wouldnt do for youJerry I sayJerry Youd be in a Blazing bad wayif recalling to life was to come into fashionJerry
