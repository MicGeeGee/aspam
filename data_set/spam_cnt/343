Breast augmentation is a surgical procedure in which the size and shape of a woman's breasts are enhanced, usually through the placement of an implant behind each breast. It is also possible to enlarge the breasts using fat harvested from another area of the patient's body, such as the abdomen or the buttocks.

<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Clinically known as augmentation mammoplasty, breast augmentation is generally performed for cosmetic purposes, whether to add volume to disproportionately small breasts, restore balance to asymmetrical breasts, or simply create a more voluptuous figure. Although the risks of breast implants have been the focus of much media attention, the rate of satisfaction among patients who have had their breasts enlarged is among the highest in cosmetic medicine.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">One of the primary reasons for the popularity of breast augmentation is that the procedure can readily be customized to the specific goals of the individual patient. Women who undergo breast augmentation have a variety of options at their disposal, giving them tremendous control over their outcome. These options include:<br />Breast Implant Type: Currently, women in the United States can choose between silicone gel-filled implants, saline-filled implants, and form-stable, ultra-cohesive silicone gel-filled (known informally as "gummy bear") implants.<br />Breast Implant Placement: Breast implants can be placed in pockets made either beneath the pectoral muscle (the submuscular placement method) or in front of the pectoral muscle, immediately behind the breast tissue (the subglandular or submammary placement method).<br />Location of the Incision: Breast implants may be placed through inframammary incisions (just below the crease at the base of the breast), periareolar incisions (along the border of the lower half of the areola), or transaxillary incisions (in the armpit). Some plastic surgeons also place implants through the navel (the transumbilical, or TUBA, incision); however, this method is less commonly used than the other three.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Other options include breast implant size, shape, profile, and texture. <br />Each decision a woman makes regarding her breast augmentation will influence her overall result. It is therefore important that patients understand their options fully before proceeding with surgery. A qualified, experienced plastic surgeon will take the time to explain every aspect of the procedure in clear, comprehensible terms, patiently answering any questions and addressing any concerns the patient may have.</p>
