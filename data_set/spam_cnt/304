He unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him If I could  my hands he thought I might throw off the noose and spring into the stream By diving I could evade the bullets and swimming vigorously reach the bank take to the woods and get away home My home thank God is as yet outside their lines my wife and little ones are still beyond the invaders farthest advance

An appalling splash within two yards of him was followed by a loud rushing sound DIMINUENDO which seemed to travel back through the air to the fort and died in an explosion which stirred the very river to its deeps A rising sheet of water curved over him fell down upon him blinded him strangled him The cannon had taken an hand in the game As he shook his head  from the commotion of the smitten water he heard the deflected shot humming through the air ahead and in an instant it was cracking and smashing the branches in the forest beyond<br>
<br>


They will not do that again he thought the next time they will use a charge of g I must keep my eye upon the gun the smoke will apprise me  the report arrives too late it lags behind the missile That is a good gun

Suddenly he felt himself whirled round and round  spinning like a top The water the banks the forests the now distant bridge fort and men all were commingled and blurred Objects were represented by their colors only circular horizontal streaks of color  that was all he saw He had been caught in a vortex and was being whirled on with a velocity of advance and gyration that made him giddy and sick In few moments he was flung upon the gravel at the foot of the left bank of the stream  the southern bank  and behind a projecting point which concealed him from his enemies The sudden arrest of his motion the abrasion of one of his hands on the <br>
<br>
gravel restored him and he wept with delight He dug his fingers into the sand threw it over himself in handfuls and audibly blessed it It looked like diamonds rubies emeralds he could think of nothing beautiful which it did not resemble The trees upon the bank were giant garden plants he noted a definite order in their arrangement inhaled the fragrance of their blooms A strange roseate light shone through the spaces among their trunks and the d made in their branches the music of AEolian harps He had not wish to perfect his escape  he was content to remain in that enchanting spot until retaken
<br>
<br>

A whiz and a rattle of gshot among the branches high above his head roused him from his dream The baffled cannoneer had fired him a random farewell He sprang to his feet rushed up the sloping bank and plunged into the forest
