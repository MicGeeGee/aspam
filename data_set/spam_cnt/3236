Accepting and embracing change can be difficult. Humans crave the comfort that comes with routine and familiarity, especially if we've been living the same way for a very long time. This is especially true for seniors, who may live alone for decades before they decide to move to a retirement community. Even if they crave more social interaction and struggle with daily chores, seniors are often reluctant to move into assisted living. Their fear of the unknown prevents them from seeing all of the wonderful benefits of living in a retirement community. So today, we've compiled a list of these benefits to help show seniors how wonderful assisted living can be if they have a positive attitude and embrace this rewarding change of scenery.

<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">The Benefits of Senior Living</p>

<!-- Paragraph 1 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">It's easy to make new friends. When you reach a certain age, making new friends can be a struggle because you can't rely on school or work to meet people who are similar to you. At a retirement community, however, you immediately become a part of a welcoming community of seniors. You're bound to make some great new friends among the residents (as well as the staff).</p>

<!-- Paragraph 2 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">There are a variety of activities and social events. Residents of a retirement community have so many great opportunities at their doorstep: exercise classes, visiting entertainers, group outings, movie nights, games, clubs for all sorts of hobbies . . . If you're bored, you have no one to blame but yourself.</p>

<!-- Paragraph 3 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">No cooking, housework, or property upkeep required. Homeownership comes with so many taxing chores: mowing the lawn, cleaning the bathroom, shoveling snow, etc. One of the most delightful benefits of living in a retirement community is that you won't have to worry about these tasks anymore. You won???t even have to cook your own meals!</p>

<!-- Paragraph 4 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Healthy living is accessible. Taking care of one's body and staying in good health becomes harder and harder as we age. Luckily, retirement communities offer services that make it easy to embrace healthy living. There are healthy diet options, exercise classes, and staff members dedicated to serving residents' health and wellness needs.</p>
