<fieldset style="position:absolute; visibility:hidden; font-size:6px; color:#F3F3F3">Not yet trusting the tones of her voiceshe sat down on the bench beside him He recoiledbut she laid her hand upon his arm A strange thrill struck him when she did soand visibly passed over his frame he laid the knife down softlyas he sat staring at her

  Her golden hairwhich she wore in long curlshad been hurriedly pushed asideand fell down over her neck Advancing his hand by little and littlehe took it up and looked at it In the midst of the action he went astrayandwith another deep sighfell to work at his shoemaking

  But not for long Releasing his armshe laid her hand upon his shoulder After looking doubtfully at ittwo or three timesas if to be sure that it was really therehe laid down his workput his hand to his neckand took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag attached to it He opened thiscarefullyon his kneeand it contained a very little quantity of hair not more than one or two long golden hairswhich he hadin some old daywound off upon his finger

He took her hair into his hand againand looked closely at it It is the same How can it be When was it How was it

  As the concentrated expression returned to his foreheadhe seemed to become conscious that it was in hers too He turned her full to the lightand looked at her

  She had laid her head upon my shoulderthat night when I was summoned outshe had a fear of my goingthough I had noneand when I was brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve You will leave me them They can never help me to escape in the bodythough they may in the spirit Those were the words I said I remember them very well

  He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it But when he did find spoken words for itthey came to him coherentlythough slowly

  How was thisWas it you

  Once morethe two spectators startedas he turned upon her with a frightful suddenness But she sat perfectly still in his graspand only saidin a low voiceI entreat yougood gentlemendo not come near usdo not speakdo not move

  Hark he exclaimed Whose voice was that
