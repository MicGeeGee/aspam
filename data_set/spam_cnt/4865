I was ignored in the French \"I see through you\" sort of way by a gentleman, who I am certain, is the owner. Granted he was on the phone, but a polite nod or... Nice sandwich shop. Had the Turkey Caprese. Very good sandwich.  Only negative was slow service. For fast, delicious, fresh-tasting burritos, tacos \u0026 quesadillas, Mercado is where it's at. It was a saving grace after a long day of moving to Lewisburg... I would give this place 6 stars if I could. Absolutely amazing! ....Food: We had the truffle fries, lasagna, penne with the house marinara, and a black berry...

Homemade sauce that wasn't neon orange, and had herbs in it for flavor, too! My fiancee had the Cod Po Boy sandwich, and the... Amazing spot. This place was quite accommodating, as we arrived ten minutes before they closed (I know how annoying that is for the staff), as we had just...
