      <br><br>
Notes They met another compassionate soul on the road in the form of Charley However because of Joshs eagerness to show off and not have his pride stepped on they ended up being accused of stealing and counterfeiting a bill

Chapter  Summary 
<br><br>
They reached Nebraska by February They received a gift of beef bones from a butcher who heard Joeys singing They found a gentle old man who agreed to boil the beef bones for them if he could have a share of the soup He was kind to the boys and gave Josh a pair of grey socks Josh was burning with fever but Joey didnt know They stumbled upon a house where the woman went hysterical and turned them away As they were leaving the street she ran after them and apologized She asked them to share a meal with them </td>
