I also love the Counter Diner atmosphere. This place is great! The food is great! The service is great! The ambiance is great! I can't say enough about this place. I'm so glad we found it. I went here for lunch and sat on the patio.  I really enjoyed the outdoor seating and my sandwich was great. They were really busy but we were seated right... Coming through Butte on the way to WA and stopped in for dinner. Pizza was really good and the salads were great too. Great local find! Will definitely be... The salmon antipasto salad was outrageously good. Service was quick and the ambience was very enjoyable. It proved to be a very enjoyable late lunch menu. Delicious food. Their brisket and horseradish sauce was amazing. My husband ordered the fish tacos. They were good, not as amazing as the brisket though.... Passing through Jefferson City on the way to the lake. Perfect atmosphere. No wait for a table. The fish and chips, boo boo burger and onion rings were... Great sushi! Well worth the 45 minute drive from Lake Ozark. Thank you for a wonderful evening!! Best date ever. Love to eat here. Atmosphere is quaint and cozy - reminds you of going to Grandma's house - that is, if your grandma is German. Wonderful dishes with plenty... Buffalo chicken soup... Best. Thing. Ever. Desserts are also very good with strawberry shortcake being my favorite. The Argentina wrap is very good also.... When my mother had a stroke a few years ago, her biggest fear would be that people would notice, treat her differently, and make her stand out. Last night... The crust is thin \u0026 light. It's one of our favorite local hangs. The staff is AMAZING; genuinely friendly \u0026 helpful. My husband loves the HUGE salads-lots... Great food and staff. ..Well known for there Ecco Burger , Onion rings, or the Breaded Pork Tenderloin. ..Cool and Oldf8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
