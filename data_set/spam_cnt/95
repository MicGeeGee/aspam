Top Things to See and Do in Belize
Belize Zoo - One of the most popular attractions in Belize City is its zoo. With the tagline "the best little zoo in the world", the 29 acre site is home to over 120 species of animal, all native to the country. You'll get to see jaguars, macaws, snakes, pumas, and crocodiles.

Hol Chan Marine Reserve - Hol Chan is probably the most well-known marine reserve in the country and is located close to Ambergris Caye. The diving and snorkeling within the park is fantastic and includes caves, coral, and plenty of tropical fish to keep you amused. Head to nearby Shark Ray Alley for the chance to get up close and personal with sharks and rays around feeding time.

Altun Ha - Head to the Mayan site of Altun Ha to experience its well preserved ruins just 30 miles north of Belize City. The main attraction of the site is the Temple of the Masonry Altars, dating from the 7th Century. The Temple is 54 feet tall and a climb to the top rewards you with a panoramic view of the pyramids and plaza below. A half day tour costs around $50 USD and includes transport, entrance fee, a guide, and drinks.

A half day tour costs around $50 USD and includes transport, entrance fee, a guide, and drinks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">See the wildlife - Much of Central America is a wildlife observer's paradise, and this country is no exception. The marine life on show at Hol Chan and the animals in Belize Zoo are just the tip of the iceberg. Birdwatchers will enjoy Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary with its world-class spotting opportunities, while those interested in big cats flock to the country's most famous protected area Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary for its jaguars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Bacab Adventure & Eco Park - This nature preserve and theme park's slogan is "Something for Everyone". On more than 500 acres of jungle, you will find hiking trails, waterways, Howler Monkeys, a giant swimming pool with a waterfall, a Butterfly house, and crocodiles, among many other things to keep the whole family busy. Visitors can camp overnight for 10 BZD per person, and tents can be provided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Xunantunich - Xunantunich is one of Belize's most impressive and easily accessible Maya sites. Take the free ferry across the Mopan River and hike a mile uphill for tickets. Although strenuous, it is well worth the sighting of birds and butterflies, and the 7th century temples and plazas awaiting at the top. Admission is 10 BZD.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The Cayes - There are hundreds of small islands off the coast, many of them picture perfect and uninhabited. Two of the most visited cayes are Ambergris Caye and Caye Caulker. Ambergris is the largest of the Belizean cayes and the most expensive tourist destination in the country, popular with families on resort style holidays. However, its proximity to the barrier reef also draws in keen divers too. Caye Caulker on the other hand is not as touristy as Ambergris and has a more relaxed atmosphere which makes it popular with backpackers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Caracol - Caracol is the largest Mayan site and was once one of the most powerful cities in Mayan times; consequently the ruins here are vast and impressive. Unlike Altun Ha, the ruins in Caracol are less restored and are in a jungle setting, which adds to the ancient feeling of the site. The site is full of reservoirs, stellae, walls, and tombs, with the best attraction being Canaa, the Sky Place, which at 141 feet is the highest building in the country.</span></p>
