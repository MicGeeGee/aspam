Chose this place based on reviews and I couldn't be more impressed. What a wonderful experience. Amazing 5 star service and the food... wow. Just wow. I've... Normally I wouldn't rate five stars for a place like this, just because the food did not knock my socks off. But, here's two reasons why they have earned... First time here did not disappoint. Wine is priced well. Lots of bottles under $40. Cheese plate was awesome. But the best part were the owners. Very... This is really good Italian food that doesn't try to hard to be great, it just is. ....It's like New York area good Italian food. ....The restaurant space... Okay, so there is a issue that has to be addressed before the restaurants critique. I grew up in Trotwood and live in Columbus now. Its inportant to know,... This was our first visit to Olive. This was a real treat. The staff were very friendly and very helpful when it came to a food allergy.....I ordered the mixed... Wife and I both had the panko breaded white fish with two sides - vegetable beef soup and grilled vegetables.  Soup was excellent , lots of fresh vegetables... Excellent!  Just driving through and staying in Dayton for the night. This place was just what we needed after a long day of driving. ....I had the spaghetti... Always a favorite of mine when I come home to visit. The service is always great here. They will take good care of you. ....The food is always remarkable... One of my favorite Dayton spots. ....Great food, prices and service. ....Try the Greek specialties and the Lemon Chicken Rice soup. Amazing sushi with reasonable prices.  But leave room for dessert, because the Sesame Hearts are also excellent. Big cold beers and friendly staff serving some decent food.....Best place on the Miller Ln Strip by far! Positives: The brisket and ribs are both good. They dry rub and smoke the ribs - delicious. You add the sauce of your choice at the table. This worked out...f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
